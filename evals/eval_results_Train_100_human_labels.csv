He was offered a different position, which he refused. His doctor released him to return to work on May 5, which was before the end of the combined 12-week period of leave he would have been entitled to had the leave been calculated correctly.\nPeters filed suit against Gilead in federal court, alleging violations of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the FMLA, and the Americans with Disabilities Act. He also sued for retaliatory discharge and promissory estoppel under Indiana law. ""Promissory estoppel"" occurs when an employer makes a promise and an employee relies on that promise to his detriment. Gilead asked the court to dismiss the case without a trial, which the court did, and Peters appealed to the Seventh Circuit.\nCourt\'s decision'

 ""Court's decision\nBecause Peters didn't work at a work site that employed 50 workers or was within a 75-mile radius of other Gilead work sites that, in total, employed 50 or more workers, the court determined that he wasn't eligible for protection under the FMLA. But that didn't eliminate Gilead's potential liability for terminating his employment before the expiration of what would otherwise have been 12 weeks of FMLA leave.\nThe court noted that Gilead's employee handbook promised 12 weeks of leave for employees who had worked 12 months and at least 1,250 hours during the last 12 months (as Peters had). It further noted that Gilead repeated that promise in notices it sent to Peters. The court didn't address whether the handbook and notices created a binding contract. Instead, it skipped directly to Peters' claim that he was entitled to reinstatement.""

In the primitive years of search engine optimization, popular search engines like Google, used their own algorithms to index websites and web pages according to the niche they targeted. After indexing the websites, they would rank them in accordance to which the websites would appear on the search results. A website with the best rank would appear as the first result and it would move downwards on that page and to subsequent pages of search results according to rankings. Today, companies target their specific niches or a set of keywords that define their industry and use various SEO strategies to get a higher rank.\nHow does SEO work?'
 ""SEO: Search engine optimization\nIt's easy for many to start a website, though hard for them to maintain their overall visibility to their audience. A webmaster, however, can make a few changes to their website, in order to deter most of the issues stemming from this problem. One of the most common and oft talked about ways to go about this involves utilizing search engine optimization techniques.\nVisability on search engines\nSearch engine optimization, also known as SEO, refers to the act of affecting how visible a website appears to a search engine, determining how a site will rank within search engine results pages or SERPs. A search engine, like Google, generates pages of results after a user enters in a search query or keywords, targeted to their subject of interest.\nKeyword optimization""
 ""SEO helps webmasters create user friendly websites\nSearch engine optimization is designed to be used to a webmaster's advantage, provided they follow the rules and conditions that come with using SEO. As an example, popular search engine Google commonly enforces their set of rules regarding the use of search engine optimization techniques for websites. Webmasters who use more exploitative SEO are frequently penalized by Google. To avoid this, many often recommended to produce better and informative web content, use search keywords sparingly and make the website assessable to all users.""
 'SEO or search engine optimization is a horde of procedures or practices that enables a web page, website, blog, forum or just an article on the internet to be easily searchable by the major search engines.

By being court-martialed, regardless of the outcome, Manning may do more to further his own views than Snowden, who is on the run and trying to find a way to avoid the consequences of his actions.'
 'The other day I came across an interesting tweet in my timeline, RT‚Äôd by someone I follow. Although I don‚Äôt remember the exact wording, the tweet called on the U.S. government to stop persecuting PFC Bradley Manning, the soldier accused of leaking classified information about our wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.\nThe word that caught my eye, and I remember it clearly being part of the tweet, was ‚Äúpersecuting.‚Äù In my mind, Manning isn‚Äôt being persecuted ‚Ä¶ he‚Äôs being prosecuted. Manning violated military regulations ‚Äî that he was well aware of, I may add ‚Äî and now he‚Äôs being held accountable for his actions. The government didn‚Äôt seek him out for punishment based on his views.'
 'I suspect Manning will be convicted of most if not all charges. The case seems cut-and-dried, and as we always said when I was on active duty: They don‚Äôt court-martial the innocent. Still, as an individual Manning stood up for what he believed in and he will pay the cost of that. He was prosecuted, not persecuted.\nTo me, that‚Äôs where a difference between Snowden and Ellsberg is as well. Ellsberg stayed in the US to face the charges, Snowden didn‚Äôt.'
 'But first, Snowden has to stand up and be counted.\nI recently re-read Fields of Fire by Senator James Webb, a outstanding novel about the Vietnam War. I greatly admire Webb, who was a highly decorated Marine officer in Vietnam and later Secretary of the Navy when I was a Petty Officer Second Class.\nThere is an strong scene late in the book in which Will Goodrich, who leaves Harvard out of apathy and ends up in Vietnam as a draftee, is visited by his former roommate Mark, who avoided the draft by fleeing to Canada. Goodrich‚Äôs father, a lawyer, calls the police and the roommate is arrested. In this passage, quoted at length, Goodrich and his father discuss what happened:\nGoodrich held his buzzing head in both hands. The world had just succeeded in finding the final little nudge that sent it topsy-turvy. ‚ÄúHe didn‚Äôt do anything really wrong, Dad.

Kennickell, assistant director of the Federal Reserve Board's Division of Research and Statistics. This paper, published Jan. 7, 2009, found that the top 1 percent's share of income was 21.4 percent in 2007 -- slightly lower than the 23.5 percent that Sanders cited but certainly in the ballpark. That's also higher than the 14.6 percent taken by the bottom 50 percent, which is consistent with what Sanders had said.\nAnother study, published in 2010 by Adrian Dungan and Kyle Mudry of the Internal Revenue Service's Individual Returns Analysis Section, found the top 1 percent taking 22.8 percent of income. Once again, this is slightly lower than what Sanders quoted, but in the same vicinity. That was also well over the 12.3 percent earned by the bottom 50 percent, which is once again consistent with what Sanders said.""
 ""In a chart subsequently updated by Saez and forwarded to us by Sanders' office, the percentage of income earned by the top 1 percent actually fell modestly by 2008, to just under 21 percent. Still, Sanders was specific in his speech about referring to 2007, and the number he cited was calculated by a credentialed academic economist specializing in income and wealth statistics -- a pretty credible source, in our view. So the number looked pretty solid to us.\nStill, we've looked at a similar question before, so we were aware that various economists have attempted to grapple with this question. In the interest of making extra certain that Sanders was right, we decided to see whether the results in the Saez study mirrored those published elsewhere.""
 'decided to do just that.\nWe\'ll take a look at two of the claims Sanders made. In this item, we\'ll look at how Sanders characterizes the income earned by the top 1 percent of Americans. In a separate item, we\'ll look at whether Sanders is correct about the tax bill paid by oil giant ExxonMobil.\nHere\'s a portion of Sanders\' speech, which came during Senate debate over extending tax cuts passed under President George W. Bush. Democrats and Republicans divided over whether the cuts should be extended for the wealthiest Americans.\n.""\nTo keep matters simple, we\'ll stick to checking Sanders\' claim that ""the top 1 percent of all income earners in the United States made 23.5 percent of all income,"" which is ""more than the entire bottom 50 percent.""'
 'When we asked Sanders\' office for a source, they pointed us to a study dated Aug. 5, 2009 by University of California (Berkeley) economist Emmanuel Saez, ""Striking it Richer: The Evolution of Top Incomes in the United States (update with 2007 estimates)."" We looked at the paper and found this line: The top 1 percent ""has gone through enormous fluctuations along the course of the twentieth century, from about 18 percent (of income) before WWI, to a peak to almost 24 percent in the late 1920s, to only about 9 percent during the 1960s-1970s, and back to almost 23.5 percent by 2007.""

59,1000,200,all-MiniLM-L6-v2,5,ollama3_1,What are the four phenomenological constants described by Sch√∂n that could form a matrix for reflective practice within interdisciplinary research contexts?,"According to Sch√∂n (1983), the four phenomenological constants that could form a matrix for reflective practice within interdisciplinary research contexts are: the overarching theories by which they make sense of phenomena, the role frames within which they set their tasks and through which they bound their institutional settings.","['Sch√∂n (1991:269) in his discussion of reflective practice argues that variations between professions (as the modern ‚Äòknowledge agent‚Äô ideal type) can be contrasted with specific constants. He argues that these constants provide for a means of considering the variation of practice between different professions. Members of disciplinary cultures are readily socialised into patterned forms of knowledge, interpretation and practice. The academic tribes of ‚Äòsociologists‚Äô, ‚Äòcomputer scientists‚Äô or ‚Äòdiscourse analysts‚Äô and ‚Äòsocial statisticians‚Äô are anthropologically consistent in this regard. Whilst wider institutional and socio-technical forces are revolutionising knowledge work in ways not anticipated twenty to thirty years ago, distinct ‚Äòprofessional groups‚Äô remain with new ones emerging on the horizon e.g. the data scientist.\nAccording to Sch√∂n (1983:270) these constants or ‚Äòpatterns‚Äô associated with knowledge groups and agents can be described in terms of the following:'
 '- The overarching theories by which they make sense of phenomena\n- The role frames within which they set their tasks and through which\nthey bound their institutional settings\nPerhaps these four phenomenological constants could form a matrix through which we can begin to link reflection with a more mindful form of reflective practice within interdisciplinary research contexts. In terms of the case being considered, perhaps collaboration between computer scientists and sociologists (and other social scientists) might benefit from some form of systematic training for those embarking on cross-disciplinary engagement in the hope of charting new territory and understanding new things through innovative theoretical, methodological and data driven interdisciplinary strategies. At the very least it is worth thinking about as a means of informing the process through which we become practical interdisciplinarians.\nReferences:'
 'A useful resource here can be found in Sch√∂n‚Äôs ideas surrounding ‚Äòthe reflective practitioner‚Äô (1983). This was a popular trope in the late 1980‚Äôs and 1990‚Äôs for developing the knowledge capacity of key professional groups such as nurses, social workers, engineers, architects and teachers as they confronted new problems, institutional structures and the reorganization of working life around teams and inter-professional working and delivery. I re-introduce it now as it might be an effective starting point for thinking about how we might promote reflective engagement by participants within interdisciplinary contexts such as ‚Äòdigital social research‚Äô, ‚Äòcomputational social science‚Äô and related fields such as ‚Äòsocial media analytics‚Äô; betwixt and between different academic groups and aligned ‚Äòknowledge agents‚Äô often collaborating and competing, working and fighting, in liminal, status poor spaces.'
 'A key issue here is the ways in which core disciplinary concerns and questions coalesce and shape how, for example, an interdisciplinary research group may approach a specific research problem. This is more than language and more akin to a requirement to spend some time immersing oneself or at least systematically reflecting on different disciplinary forms of life and the social life of paradigms. Whilst I am looking at a problem or phenomenon in terms of prosaic questions such as social organization my computer scientist friend maybe viewing these through the lens of information and dreams of automation.'

 'people, the United States should take responsibility for that.‚Äù It is practically impossible for the government to take open responsibility for the consequences of targeting killing when an action is done under the rubric of covert action, which is the rubric the CIA typically operates under. As noted above, DOD/JSOC is not presently more transparent than CIA. But, the argument goes, moving the bulk of targeted strikes to JSOC (and as a general matter outside the rubric of covert action) at least holds open the possibility of more public transparency. Brennan is reportedly in the camp that wants to move targeted killing to JSOC, perhaps for this reason. Maybe he is right. But we can have the debate about the proper distribution of drone-strike capabilities across the government without current and former officials inaccurately portraying the CIA in this context as a rogue actor.'

This not only enables the employee to assess the relative importance of everything he or she is accountable for, but also provides a sense of where the job fits into the company as a whole.\n- Job descriptions are helpful to applicants, employees, supervisors, and human resources professionals at every stage in the employment relationship, from recruitment to retirement. They provide information about the knowledge, raining, education, and skills needed for each job. They prevent misunderstandings by telling employees what they need to know about their jobs. Best of all, they provide this information in a completely objective and impersonal way.\n- Job descriptions help management analyze and improve the company‚Äôs structure. They reveal whether all company responsibilities are adequately covered and where these responsibilities should be reallocated to achieve a better balance.'
 'Job Descriptions Basics\nWhat Is A Job Description?\nA job description is a written statement that describes the main objective of a job, its essential and nonessential functions, the qualifications, and other information.\nA job description may describe duties, skills, effort, and responsibilities, environmental and working conditions, and the education and experience required. It also may include information on tools and equipment used and relationships with other jobs.\nThirty people may hold the same job and, therefore, use the same job description. It is important to remember that a job description describes the job, not the person or persons who hold that job.\nThere are two basic types of job descriptions: ‚Äúgeneric‚Äù or general and ‚Äúspecific‚Äù or individual. In addition, position descriptions often are written for individual, high-level managerial employees.\nSpecific Or Generic?'
 '- Accurate job descriptions provide a basis for job evaluation, wage and salary surveys, and an equitable wage and salary structure.\nFinally, they provide a basis from which to determine whether a disabled applicant is otherwise qualified for the job and, if so, what accommodation should be made to let the applicant perform the essential functions of the position.\nSo Many Jobs, So Little Time: The Bane\nDespite these and other benefits, job descriptions traditionally have suffered a poor reputation among managers and human resources staffers. In fact, job descriptions often end up being ignored. ‚ÄúJob descriptions? Sure, we have them. They‚Äôre in the bottom drawer of that file cabinet with the big stack of books in front of it.'
 'Doing It Right The First Time\nYet, one of the most common reasons a job description isn‚Äôt used is because it isn‚Äôt useful. In other words, it lacks validity, and therefore it fails to achieve its potential.\nA job description is valid to the extent that it accurately reflects job content. An out-of-date job description obviously is not valid. But even descriptions written yesterday can suffer from a lack of validity.; and employees may end up struggling to achieve unrealistic standards of performance. And this is only the tip of the iceberg!\nThe typical job description is often deficient in at least one of the following ways:\n- The description exaggerates or downplays the importance of the job.\n- It fails to pinpoint the critical elements that differentiate between successful and unsuccessful job performance.\n- It ignores the decision-making aspects of the job.\n- It either fails to focus on the job incumbent‚Äôs actual behavior or it defines required behavior in ambiguous terms.'
 'The issue is that even the most thoughtful, well-written job descriptions are flawed from the outset. That‚Äôs because job descriptions:\n- Are unrealistic: At a lot of companies, job descriptions end up becoming a wish-list that has very little to do with the actual skills necessary to do the job. Every stakeholder in the process adds more and more nice-to-haves, until they end up obscuring the genuine must-haves.\n- Are misaligned: There‚Äôs often a discrepancy between the skills listed on a job description and the skills that are tested during the interview process. This is very prevalent for technical roles, where interviews often focus on algorithmic or data structure questions that have little to do with the job at hand.']","The main concern of the individual is that they are labeled as an ""A"" while everyone else is a ""B"".

It educated students through an inclusive, generalist philosophy that taught many different approaches to practicing psychology and the many roles that graduates might be called on to play in their vocations.\nAt the Beginning\nWhen the program opened in June 1982, AUNE was located on Roxbury Street. It was the beginning of the expansion of psychological services across the country. AUNE‚Äôs PsyD program was initially directed by David L. Singer, who was also director of AUNE‚Äôs master‚Äôs in psychology program and taught at AUNE from 1977 to 1993.'
 'It won‚Äôt surprise you that AUNE‚Äôs Department of Clinical Psychology, launched thirty years ago, was innovative right from the start.\n‚ÄúEven from the beginning, we imagined ourselves as visionaries,‚Äù said Roger Peterson, professor and Distinguished Senior Scholar in the Department of Clinical Psychology, who joined the first PsyD faculty in the fall of 1982. ‚ÄúComing out of the seventies, we were less hierarchical and more open to new ways of thinking. We were alternative! We were really trying to do something different in clinical psychology education.‚Äù\nThat something was to educate psychologists as practitioner-scholars, well-rounded clinicians with a broad range of skills and competencies who would be integrated into their communities, especially important in rural New England. It ran counter to the typical doctoral program of the day which trained people in narrow research areas, with an academic rather than practical focus.'
 'The Center for Research on Psychological Practices (CROPP) was founded in 1996 as a research center incorporating applied clinical research and evaluation skills, especially in the area of health care systems.\nIn 2000, the Multicultural Center for Research and Practice was started to foster multiculturalism, social justice, and, through its support of Support Group for Ethnic and Racial Diversity (SERD)/Disaster Shakti, community service. It reflects the philosophy that AUNE‚Äôs PsyD program was built on thirty years ago.\nThe spirit that was at the beginning is still here today, we are for social justice and I think we were from the beginning, Roger said. The relationship and growth of people as professionals is also here. It‚Äôs deep in the roots of AUNE.'
 'Twenty students were admitted that first semester, ten in the first-year program and ten in the second-year program. In 1982, there were just two full-time core faculty members, David Singer and Roger Peterson. There were some part-time faculty too, Colby Smith, who has been with AUNE since 1977. At the time, matriculating students were required to have a master‚Äôs degree, a requirement that was dropped in the early 1990s. (Now, about 25 percent of students entering the PsyD program have a master‚Äôs.) There were only twenty-six PsyD programs in the United States; now there are at least three times that number, but AUNE‚Äôs is still the only clinical psychology doctoral program in New Hampshire. The American Psychological Association awarded the program its first accreditation in 1986.'
 'The PsyD had been essentially founded by Donald Peterson, professor of psychology at Rutgers University and a mentor to Roger, in the 1960s. In the 1990s, Roger and some national colleagues went on to develop the professional training model now used by most PsyD programs in the country. One element of that model is the Professional Seminar, originated at AUNE as part of our practitioner-scholar approach to clinical psychology. The ProSem model asks students, working in groups, to regularly learn academic material, examine self-in-role, and discuss their clinical work. It promotes self-reflection said Colby, now a professor of clinical psychology, who started as an adjunct faculty member at AUNE in 1977.\nFocus on Rural Mental Health']","The innovative approach of AUNE's Department of Clinical Psychology was to educate psychologists as practitioner-scholars, well-rounded clinicians with a broad range of skills and competencies who would be integrated into their communities.

 'Reasonable arguments like this are not new, but they perennially face an incredible barrier that can be summed up best this way: The most insurmountable addiction problem encountered in the Drug War is not the addiction to drugs; it is the societal addiction to police, the military, courts and prisons.

I know roughly where it was: along the Whau River shoreline, between the railway line and bridge (north of Olympic Park) and the Whau Bridge at Great North Road. This was all land owned by John Buchanan, one of the early elders of the Avondale Presbyterian Church and an agent for the first landowner, John Shedden Adam. But, with Bell (a member of the Whau Public Hall Committee and auditor for the Highway District Board) and Gemmell either working for Buchanan or leasing the property for the tannery from him, details are sketchy. There is, however, a likely archaeological site worth investigating along that stretch of the river, if anyone cared to give it a go.'
 'By 1885, however, it appears that the firm had vanished from Avondale\'s landscape. Perhaps Buchanan pulled the plug in selling his ""Avondale Estate"" in February 1884. Perhaps the Long Depression began to bite, and the removal of the Gittos Tannery in 1886 convinced the firm to pack up and leave the area themselves. I\'m just not sure -- but if anyone reading this sees any further references to them or to the tannery, I\'d appreciate the info.\nAn update (31 October 2008): On reading through some notes and articles I have on the Gittos tannery in Avondale, I saw that both a Mr. Bell and ""R. Gemmell"" were around in the Whau village in the late 1860s, associated with the Whau Minstrels, which took in most of its members from the Gittos tannery. Slender stuff, but Bell & Gemmell, like Elijah Astley, may have learned the skills of the leather trade while working at Gittos\', and then branched out with Buchanan\'s assistance.\nFurther update (5 November) here.'
 'The tannery appears to have been operating as early as 1878. In November 1879, the firm won a first prize at the Auckland Agricultural & Pastoral Show for ""sole leather, sides, kip, butts, tweed, calfskins, memel kip, belting, hose leather, black and brown harness and bag leather."" That\'s quite a range of product. All else that is known comes from a scattering of contemporary sources.\nHerald, 1882: ""On part of Mr. Buchanan‚Äôs estate, at the head of the Whau Creek, is the fellmongery and tanning establishment of Messrs. Bell and Gemmell, who, from small beginnings, have now succeeded in acquiring a business which is as large as their plant can overtake. They are now making additions to buildings and machinery with a view to an extension of their trade. Out of the 16 acres available they are about to plant a considerable breadth in wattle, so as to produce their own wattle bark at first hand, and save expense of importation.""'

A prospective open-label trial of galantamine in ASD showed it was well-tolerated and beneficial for interfering behaviors, particularly aggression, behavioral dyscontrol and inattention [8].

Ecitalopram at 10 mg/d, for 4 weeks, was introduced for aggression, but to no avail. We suggested a trial with Mirtazapine as data from the literature support its use for sexually-inappropriate behaviors in ASD, and also to help with sleep and irritability. We went to 45 mg/d over 4 weeks. Sleep improved markedly, irritability diminished significantly and most importantly, sexual behaviors were greatly tamed. Both frequency and severity of aggression became obviously less. This was well-sustained at follow-ups W-6, 8, and 12.

 'Quantum Entanglement and Teleportation relation\nThis teleportation that the Scientists did, was not quite the disappearing of something that reappears elsewhere, magically ‚Äì but the production of an exact copy of that something with its information, by the means of quantum entanglement. Let me explain.\nImagine looking into a mirror. If you wave your hand at it, your reflection waves back. In quantum entanglement terms; you are entangled with your reflection (‚Äòentangled‚Äô means you are connected in a ‚Äúspooky‚Äù way no one knows of yet) ‚Äì so by altering your information (by waving), due to this entanglement, your reflection alters theirs instantly ‚Äì producing an exact copy of your wave, thus, your reflection waves back at you. As a result, your waving hand has teleported to your reflection. Still don‚Äôt get it? This very short video will definitely help you out.\nThis is how the photon was teleported into Space by the scientists. Mind bending, right? That‚Äôs the Quantum world for you.'
 'Teleportation in REAL LIFE\nIn fact, this altered definition of teleportation has recently allowed for scientists in China to teleport a photon from Earth into Space. Although a photon is not a physical object, it‚Äôs a start, and could revolutionize all sorts of things which I will discuss later on. First, we must dive back into the realm of Quantum Physics to understand how this teleportation actually worked.\nThe Alien World of Quantum Physics\nIt doesn‚Äôt sound nice, I know, but I will make this as understandable as I can for you readers. The problem with Quantum Physics, is that it defies logic. They say that if you believe that you understand Quantum Physics, then you don‚Äôt understand it at all. The more you learn about it; the more it confuses you. Quantum Entanglement is certainly not an exception.\nQuantum Entanglement'
 'Quantum Entanglement\nHaving said how crazy quantum can get; quantum entanglement is when you have two particles that are physically separated from each other ‚Äì yet they still have some sort of connection between them [1]. This connection allows them to influence each other instantaneously ‚Äì on any scale you want. Imagine you are here on Earth; and on the other side of the Universe you have a person who is ‚Äòentangled‚Äô to you ‚Äì If you clap, the person on the other side of the Universe also claps‚Ä¶ instantaneously.\nSounds completely alien right? Surprisingly, it has been proven with quantum particles over and over again. This is incredibly shocking, as on a large scale of distance, this passage of information would break the fastest possible speed in the Universe ‚Äì the speed of light. This defies the laws of Physics. So how does this relate to how the scientists in China managed to teleport a photon 300 miles, from Earth into Space?\nQuantum Entanglement and Teleportation relation'
 'This is how the photon was teleported into Space by the scientists. Mind bending, right? That‚Äôs the Quantum world for you.\nWill teleportation on a large physical scale ever occur?\nWith the technology we now have, probably not. By using quantum entanglement ‚Äì teleportation has been done with atoms, but not with anything bigger. It becomes too complex as you can imagine, but by no means am I saying it is impossible ‚Äì it could be done.\nWhat can this quantum teleportation help us with if we were to achieve it?\nIf we can‚Äôt teleport a McDonalds directly to our beds, what‚Äôs the point of this so called ‚Äòachievement‚Äô ‚Äì why is it a breakthrough? Turns out, this form of teleportation has a huge impact ‚Äì especially in the world of computers.

20,1000,200,all-MiniLM-L6-v2,5,ollama3_1,What are some of the guidelines for disciplining a teenager?,"When disciplining a teenager, never use physical or mental torture, don't give in to tantrums or loud and intimidating behavior, and don't allow guilt to cloud your judgment.","['On the other hand, constructive discipline tends to result in the development of a mature young adult by the end of the adolescent passage. It helps a teenager control his impulses, cooperate with other people, and be patient. The aim of discipline should not be to develop a homogenized and completely socialized teenager; parents should always stress the uniqueness of their teenage sons and daughters. Rather, discipline should result in a teen taking a wholehearted and responsible approach to life. Disciplining a teenager is different from disciplining a younger child since the teenager is more mature, more reflective, and more able to enter into discussions and negotiations. This means that discipline can and should always be enlightening to teenagers, never a means of deriding, shaming, or making them feel as if they are ‚Äúbad.‚Äù\nWhat to Do'
 'When disciplining a teenager you need to remember that the actions that you take when your child breaks the rules are actions that will hopefully help your child learn. Parents question how much ‚Äúrope‚Äù to give a child, worrying that there might be too much, and the child will ‚Äúhang himself.‚Äù Other parent‚Äôs worry that being too strict will result in their teen rebelling, losing respect, and not loving them. Others consider rebellion and defiance to be ‚Äúnormal‚Äù in teenagers and thus may rarely take a teen‚Äôs misbehavior seriously. While to some degree rebellion and defiance are natural, it has been found that excessive rebellion and excessive defiance are usually indicators of an oppositional defiant behavior disorder and are not necessarily associated with health.'
 '- Never use physical or mental torture.\n- Don‚Äôt give in to tantrums or loud and intimidating behavior, and don‚Äôt allow guilt to cloud your judgment.\n- Remember, teenagers test the limits. You will be tested!\nIn the end, be compassionate and empathetic and remember what it was like to be a teenager. Your greatest influence on your child doesn‚Äôt come through your punishment but through your being a good role model and your ability to understand the situation and act appropriately..'
 'The problem is that most parents only have the model of discipline that was meted out to them as children and teens. For many, identification with the normal rebellious and defiant aspects of the teenage years has never been normalized by mature growth; thus they either subtly (or not so subtly) stimulate ‚Äúbad behavior,‚Äù only to follow it, in their own anxiety and confusion, by administering punishment to the adolescent. Not surprisingly, this causes the teen perplexity, anxiety, and confusion.'
 'For example, counselors have helped kids get back into school (for some crimes, schools do not have to readmit) or gone to court as advocates.\nThe program covers practical aspects of daily life most of us assume everybody else knows. Everything from how to apply for jobs and then manage money once employed ‚Äî getting a checkbook and how to use it ‚Äî plus how to get along with family and friends.

 'At one time, first and second names had sensible meanings. Thomas meant a twin, Alice meant truth, William meant strong minded and most likely our remote ancestors had to earn their names. But nowadays parents tend to name their children. for older relatives. An only child might be named Thomas after an uncle who was a twin and young William might be a sissy.\nThe original meanings of first names were forgotten long before second names were invented. At first second names also made sense, but they also soon lost their meanings, In England, second names came into style about 900 years ago.

3,1000,200,all-MiniLM-L6-v2,5,ollama3_1,What is the main difference between the National Sample Survey (NSS) and the India Human Development Survey (IHDS) in terms of measuring India's inequality?,"The main difference between the National Sample Survey (NSS) and the India Human Development Survey (IHDS) in terms of measuring India's inequality is that NSS measures consumption, whereas IHDS measures income.","['This ‚Äúreasonableness‚Äù of the data, and the absence of discontinuities when comparing income and consumption leads one to believe that it is possible that both NSS and IHDS provide accurate information (with likely underestimation of top-end consumption and income), but that income distribution in India is much more unequally distributed than consumption.\nSo if we compare India with other countries that use income surveys, this is how it looks (see the figure below). India seems slightly more unequal than Brazil, and more egalitarian than only South Africa.\nThere are many other issues that are worth exploring here, in particular if we want to look more carefully at the consistency between the two surveys, but I would like to end by considering the role of the new income survey for India from an unusual angle.'
 'As mentioned before, since NSS was the only game in town, all our global poverty and inequality statistics were done using NSS. Now, if we replace NSS with the new income survey as I have done for the global inequality calculation for the year 2011 (unpublished), you may expect that the greater inequality revealed by IHDS would push global inequality up, especially since India is such a populous country. Right?\nWrong.\nWhat happens is that global inequality goes down by approximately 1 Gini point since the higher income levels implied by IHDS push Indians toward the middle of the global income distribution and more than offset the contribution to higher global inequality that comes from the stretched-out Indian distribution. Thus, somewhat paradoxically, a global implication of a new, and I think more reasonable, approach of viewing India as a country with Latin American levels of income inequality is that global inequality, as calculated so far, might have been overestimated.'
 'And if indeed that was the reason, or one of the reasons, then another unpleasant conclusion imposed itself: inequality in India may be (far) higher than implied by NSS data.\nAnd indeed, as the graph below shows, NSS kept on producing a fairly stable consumption Gini (calculated here on household per capita basis) over several decades, with only a small increase in inequality after India‚Äôs sharp turn toward capitalism in the early 1990s. That Gini, ranging between mid- and higher-30s, made India inequality look about the same as in developed countries.\n/>\nBut until recently we had no other reliable and nationally-representative survey to confront NSS with. Now, thanks to the joint work by University of Maryland and National Council of Applied Research in New Delhi, we have (harmonized by LIS), the first income based surveys of Indian population for 2004 and, just released by LIS, another same survey for 2011.'
 'How unequal is India? The question is simple, the answer is not.\nFor some 60 years, the only reliable information about India‚Äôs inequality was coming from the annual National Sample Survey conducted from 1951. NSS is one of the most venerable surveys in the world of poverty and income distribution statistics. India started fielding it soon after its independence: the survey was supposed to track how the new government fought poverty, to provide information on caste differences, rural-urban gap, caloric intake, especially of the poor and many other statistics. Since its main concern was with poverty, the decision was made to survey consumption, that is, how much people actually consume (do they have sufficient number of calories) rather than income (how many rupees they earn).'
 'And the results are very different from NSS‚Äôs. First, Indian Gini is remarkably consistent in both 2004 and 2011 and is (on per capita basis) 51 Gini points. This is at the level of Latin American countries and is some 15 points (or almost 40% ) higher than the Gini‚Äôs calculated from NSS. Thus a key question is immediately asked: is India‚Äôs inequality more like Latin American? NSS was saying for years that it is not; the India Human Development Survey (IHDS) argues it is.']","The main difference between the NSS and the IHDS in terms of measuring India's inequality is that the NSS focused on consumption, that is, how much people actually consume, while the IHDS is based on income. The NSS was showing consistently lower rates of growth and higher poverty, while the IHDS revealed a higher level of inequality, similar to Latin American countries.",0.148148148,0.679166667,0.374888315,0.683844887,-0.00044674,3,

 ""The Remedy\nBefore you outsource this vital part of your business, seek out companies with good reputation and those that have been in business for a while. Call centers that have low turn-over and have on site staff tend to offer a much higher level of service. Happier employees will translate into many more happy interactions with your clients. The call centers who invest in more advanced training, and who offer bilingual services, will undoubtedly elevate the quality of interactions with your clients. Call centers of this high caliber often offer custom services as well, giving you a seamless transition and operate as a true extension of your business. Your clients may never know that they're dealing with a call center. The end result is a boosted bottom line due to satisfied customers, better PR for your business and higher customer retention. Isn't that the ultimate goal of any business?""
 'Time is Money\nIn an industry where time literally is money, calls are handled very differently depending on the quality of the call center and its staff. Calls are met with either an automated answering service, or an actual individual. In an attempt to remain competitive, many call centers offer little to no training and staff are strongly encouraged to keep calls extremely short. The corners that are cut to save a few bucks can be detrimental to your business or brand.\nOutsourcing\nOutsourcing overseas is one of the easiest corners to cut, and so are home based operations. Reduced wages offer big incentives that many call centers take advantage of when cutting costs. Utilizing remote staff reduces overhead and operating costs. Businesses seeking the lowest cost per call are often attracted to these call centers, and rarely understand the consequences.'

 'The tracking of health outcomes and deviations may improve the healthcare system‚Äôs ability to assess population health.

 'What.\nWhy Reader‚Äôs Theater?\nWhen using scripts written for the classroom like those in the Integrated Skills Through Drama series, the advantages of doing a script as Reader‚Äôs Theater are:\n- Learners experience both language and communication strategies in conversational contexts. They are able to feel the language from the inside and reflect on how expressions, words and phrases are used to attain conversational goals.\n- Pronunciation and intonation work is purpose-driven as actors work to communicate the emotional intention of their characters\n- The script is already prepared, giving students a language experience that can be practiced and then adapted to other contexts.\n- There‚Äôs no need for props, sets, costumes, or even a stage making it easier and quicker to produce.\n- A Reader‚Äôs Theater performance supports success by allowing actors to refer to a script. This saves time, which can be spent on ancillary skills work or even discussion of the themes of the play.\nConsiderations'
 'Somehow, I‚Äôve managed to do that several times. I think that‚Äôs quite an accomplishment.\n‚ÄúA Year In The Death Of Eddie Jester‚Äù is the one for me that has had the most success overall. It has had productions on six continents. I try to get to as many productions as I can, but it‚Äôs not always possible. A couple of years ago I was in Iowa for the premiere of one of my plays and that same week a production of Eddie Jester was mounted in Australia.\nFollowing my scripts wherever they travel has allowed me to meet some amazing people and form some strong friendships.\nWhat is a goal that you would like to accomplish in the next five years?

 'More experimental than traditional, more accessible (depending on Wi-Fi, of course!); and less formal, the digital expanse is a curious new world that‚Äôs best experienced organically. Sprawling across our phones and laptop screens, it‚Äôs probably safe to say that online theatre is no longer in its vulnerable infancy. Even institutional theatre now seems to be taking cues from it to serve the audience with a seamless experience, which before the social-distancing era was not much pondered upon.\nSpeaking at the first edition of TheatreRoom‚Äôs talk series on ‚Äòtheatre and digitality‚Äô, documentary theatre-maker and founder of Bengaluru-based collective Drama Queen Anuja Ghosalkar tells us why she feels that virtual theatre is not only about live Zooms; it‚Äôs a discourse that will continue only when we engage with it more and not assume it to be the interim. Excerpts:\nEmbracing the digital, but not giving in to triumphalism'
 'Considerations\nAs written above, Reader‚Äôs Theater can be as simple as putting students in a circle, assigning parts, and having them read a script. However, it can be a lot more involved than that as well. Here are some considerations and decisions to make:\n- A play is a story that reflects human experience and can thus lend itself to rich discussion. Spend some time talking about the story. Have students listen to the play and/or read the script first and talk about the message. Share experiences and insights into the world of the play.\n- Also consider working on the characters motivations. After students are assigned roles, have them work out the back story of the character by answering Wh- questions. Who is the character? Where did they grow up? What are they good at? or where do they struggle in life? Importantly, what do they want? How are they trying to get what they want? This can help with the pronunciation/intonation work and how they use their voice.']","Some of the benefits of becoming a Friend of the theatre include great ticket savings, priority booking, access to a Friends Hotline, and invitations to special events.

 'From the study:\nBroad improvements in college access have not necessarily produced more equitable outcomes for historically underrepresented groups as they have moved into and through the first years of college.

Figuring out how to promote more equitable outcomes is a central challenge facing the City‚Äôs policymakers and educators.\nSo far, the de Blasio administration has thrown its weight behind making it easier for students to get into college, even as the mayor has acknowledged that access and success are not the same thing and moved to add more challenging courses at city high schools.'

Then he presses into the clinch, but Cummings matches him and they jockey for position. As they break apart Nelson lands a good knee.\nNelson lands a right hook. he misses with an overhand. Nelson very relaxed, but he‚Äôs very alert and continually makes Cumming miss by backing up just enough. A right hand counter lands for Nelson, but then Cummings moves to his back and clinches up.

 'A head kick is blocked by Cummings. Pace slowed a little now in the final 90 seconds. Cummings leaps in and nelson counters with a punch to the body. More missed shots from Cummings and then he moves into the clinch. Nothing doing and they back up.

But before the city is able to cut its dependence on federal government funds, it is receiving lavish sums to help it pay for the overhaul of East Berlin‚Äôs rotting infrastructure and the merging of its eastern and western halves into one modern city.\nOf its total 1992 budget of 41.88 billion Deutsche marks (about $25 billion), Berlin will receive 38 percent in subsidies from the German government, raise 13 percent through new borrowing and generate 26 percent through taxes.'
 'Despite the greater influence of market forces in both East and West Berlin‚Äôs economic life, neither business leaders or politicians envisage a day when the city will be able to do entirely without government support. Berlin will always need a certain amount of help to pay for its many expensive cultural and educational institutions. As a consequence of its history as a divided city, Berlin has separate museum systems, universities, national theater companies and opera houses. While some of the museum collections can be merged and a few of the smaller theaters privatized, Berlin believes that in its role as Germany‚Äôs capital, it is crucial to keep the rest.'
 'Finance Senator Elmar Pieroth said the debt level, one that would be considered irresponsible under normal circumstances, was unavoidable given the magnitude of the job to be done.\n‚ÄúWe have no other choice,‚Äù he said in an interview. ‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt build the Wall back and make the East stay at the level it is today.‚Äù\nEast Berlin‚Äôs needs range from sewer equipment to telecommunications systems and include just about everything in between. Both East and West Berlin need housing, efficient power generating and distribution equipment, and better road connections to each other and the rest of Germany.'
 'While it is clear that many improvements have already been made ‚Äì public transportation runs efficiently between East and West and the phone lines across town are no longer as impossibly busy as they once were ‚Äì there remains more work to be done than originally estimated. The Berlin and German governments have already begun negotiations to extend payments from the special German Unity Fund beyond the planned cutoff date of 1995. Also being discussed is the timetable for the federal government‚Äôs move to Berlin. While Berlin is lobbying for it to take place as soon as possible, the federal government seems to want to postpone both the move and the accompanying bills until the late nineties.\nEarlier this year, Bonn even floated a trial balloon, suggesting some ministries should remain where they are.'
 'Small business has also been squeezed by the skyrocketing rates for office rental and the sharply higher costs of land.\nALTHOUGH there have been numerous calls for the government to control the rise of property and rental costs both for business and housing, Mr. Pieroth said Berliners must adapt to the prices, which are no higher than in other West German cities.']","Berlin's total 1992 budget comes from 38 percent in subsidies from the German government, 13 percent through new borrowing, and 26 percent through taxes.",0.318181818,1,0.849960405,0.762227962,0.999841618,5,

 'The shocking events at Ivel Monday morning, when an explosion destroyed five homes in the Rolling Acres subdivision, left all of us stunned and gave us reason to pause and reflect on how tragedy can strike when least expected.The clouds of smoke overhanging the scene of the disaster seemingly come with no silver lining, other than that the carnage was not more severe. However, we can find reasons to be thankful, and chief among these is that, whenever such events happen, there are those among us who rise to the occasion and set their fears, even concerns for personal safety, aside to help their neighbors.Most notable among these is Kentucky State Police Trooper Rick Conn. A resident of Rolling Acres, Conn was driving by when he was injured by the blast. Despite this, he still found the strength to escape his vehicle and go to the aid of a mother trying to flee the flames with her child. Only after the mother and child were safe did Conn collapse from his own injuries.Words are woefully']","The sequence of events began when Henry Brown hid in his estranged wife's trunk until she left the restaurant. Upon leaving the restaurant, Chericia was attacked and stabbed multiple times by Henry. After the attack, Henry changed vehicles and picked up his two children from the babysitter. He then headed to Central Florida Regional Hospital in search of his wife, and opened fire on law enforcement and security personnel in an attempt to flee. He was later discovered by police near the Seminole-Volusia county line. Upon closing in to arrest him, they found him as well as his two children dead inside. Investigators believe Brown killed his children at some point after picking them up, then committed suicide while police prepared to apprehend him. Chericia died at the hospital from her injuries.",0.051282051,0,,0,0.602341322,1,

 '‚ÄúThis is how you do it: you sit down at the keyboard and you put one word after another until it‚Äôs done.

 'This is my first Jojo Moyes book and now I want to devour everything else she‚Äôs written. I think I incorrectly wrote her off as a simple chick lit novelist, and there‚Äôs nothing wrong with chick lit, but when I opened this book I didn‚Äôt expect to find this level of character development and historical detail in her writing. Each chapter starts with real clippings from newspapers and books that talk about the ship or things happening at that time, and it really shows how much research she did to skillfully bring us into this time era and bring alive these women.'
