0,es-dense,1000,200,all-MiniLM-L6-v2,5,1,ollama3_1,What is the Berry Export Summary 2028 and what is its purpose?,"Caption: Tasmanian berry grower Nic Hansen showing Macau chef Antimo Merone around his property as part of export engagement activities.
THE RISE and rise of the Australian strawberry, raspberry and blackberry industries has seen the sectors redouble their international trade focus, with the release of a dedicated export plan to grow their global presence over the next 10 years.
Driven by significant grower input, the Berry Export Summary 2028 maps the sectors’ current position, where they want to be, high-opportunity markets and next steps.
Hort Innovation trade manager Jenny Van de Meeberg said the value and volume of raspberry and blackberry exports rose by 100 per cent between 2016 and 2017. She said the Australian strawberry industry experienced similar success with an almost 30 per cent rise in export volume and a 26 per cent rise in value to $32.6M over the same period.
“Australian berry sectors are in a firm position at the moment,” she said. “Production, adoption of protected substrate cropping, improved genetics and an expanding geographic footprint have all helped put Aussie berries on a positive trajectory.
“We are seeing a real transition point. Broad industry interest and a strong commercial appetite for export market development combined with the potential to capitalise on existing trade agreements and build new trade partnerships has created this perfect environment for growth.”
High-income countries across Europe, North America and Northern Asia have been identified as having a palate for Australian grown berries with more than 4244 tonnes of fresh berries exported in the last financial year alone.
The strategy identified the best short-term prospect markets for the Australian blackberry and raspberry industry as Hong Kong, Singapore, The United Arab Emirates and Canada. The strongest short-term trade options identified for the strawberry sector were Thailand, Malaysia, New Zealand and Macau.
The strategy focuses heavily on growing the existing strawberry export market from 4 per cent to at least 8 per cent of national production by volume, in markets with a capacity and willingness to pay a premium for quality fruit. For raspberries and blackberries, the sectors aim to achieve a 5 per cent boost in exports assessed by volume across identified markets by 2021.
Tasmanian raspberry exporter Nic Hansen said Australia offers some of the sweetest and most attractive berries in the world, and this combined with our stringent food safety standards across all stages of the supply chain puts growers in a solid position.
“We have a great product, we are hungry to expand trade and now with this new plan in place, we have a clear roadmap towards driving growth,” Mr Hansen said.
He said it is exciting to see new export market prospects for raspberries: “The more options we have for export the better. Now we just have to get on with the job of ensuring industry has all the tools it needs, such as supporting data and relationship building opportunities, to thrive in new markets.”
This project was commissioned by Hort Innovation, and developed by market analysts and research consultants Auspex Strategic Advisory and AgInfinity. Hort Innovation will work now with berry sectors to determine levy-funded activities to support trade.

Perspectives
Reach and benefits:
- Self-supply is practised by millions of rural households in Sub-Sahara Africa as well as in Europe, USA and other areas of the world.
- Benefits reported from having access to Self-supply water sources include convenience, less time spent for fetching water and access to more and better quality water. In some areas, Self-supply sources offer important added values such as water for productive use, income generation, family safety and improved food security.
- Sustainability of services from Self-supply is high as there is strong ownership by people investing in own sources.
- As Self-supply sources are shared sources, many people, including poor and vulnerable households, benefit from investments in Self-supply, often at no costs. This means that Self-supply can be effective in reaching the hard-to-reach.
- For millions of people in rural areas of Africa, supported Self-supply will be the most cost effective service delivery model to provide access to safe water. This also includes those parts of the population which actually have poor access as they e.g. cannot afford water from communal supplies.
- However, in areas where external support for Self-supply is lacking, only marginal improvements can usually be achieved, and the quality of services is lower than in areas where a dedicated support effort was made.
Costs and business model for supported Self-supply
- In many rural contexts, supported Self-supply is the most cost effective approach for water service delivery. However, as it is not applicable in all contexts, a blended approach combining communal water supply and supported Self-supply models should be followed.
- Based on a Life Cycle Cost (LCC) analysis of different service delivery approaches, the LCC for communal supplies are about 40 US$/capita served in the study countries, whereas the LCC for supported Self-supply is about 10 U$/capita.
- In sparsely populated areas, communal supplies (e.g. handpumps) are even more costly (up to 100 U$/capita served) as only few people can be served with one additional unit. Serving all rural people with communal supply is therefore not financially viable.
- Considering the applicability of Self-supply technologies, in Zambia and Zimbabwe, the cost saving of following a blended approach using both communal supplies and supported Self-supply is almost 50% of the total LCC for reaching 100% of the population by 2030. These cost savings are equivalent to more than 330 million US$ in Zambia and more than 260 million US$ in Zimbabwe.
Support services needed
- Supported Self-supply is a service delivery model putting support services in place to improve Self-supply, so it is not about a particular technology.
- Supported Self-supply is aligned with the Human Rights to Water and Sanitation, which allows a progressive realisation of the universal access to safe water. However, supported Self-supply is not a way to exempt government from its duties: Government has specific roles to play to ensure that everybody will have access to safe water finally.
- To sustain and to take Self-supply to scale there is need for contextualised support as well as long-term engagement, capacity development at all levels, M&E and technical support, reliable funding and learning and sharing.
- Interministerial cooperation and champions within government agencies are needed to ensure sustainable embedding and for taking Self-supply further, particularly in remote rural areas.
- There is no-one-size-fits-all solution for supported Self-supply – for each programme, it needs a contextualized design and follow-up to achieve desired impact.
- Hygiene promotion, including Household Water Treatment and Safe Storage (HWTS), is highly recommended for any non-piped water supply services, including Self-supply water sources.
- The huge potential for substantially improving the level of water supply for millions of people in rural areas should be accessed through supported Self-supply. Some countries have endorsed supported Self-supply as service delivery model, such as Zimbabwe or Sierra Leone, and in Ethiopia, Self-supply is now being scaled up at national level.

Description
Coolands for Twitter is a revolutionary twitter client. It has many unique features, gives you the best mobile twitter experience you never imagined before.
The first unique feature is Real-Time.
You can’t find any refresh button in this app, because you absolutely don’t need to. Every time you open it, you’ll get the latest tweets and while you’re reading, you’ll get incoming tweets in Real-Time. So if your friend mentioned you, you can reply instantly.
The second unique feature is Avatar Indicator.
Avatar Indicator is small avatars showed on the title bar to indicate that you’ve got new message/tweet/mention. Since it’s real-time, you’ll keep getting incoming tweets while you’re reading your older timeline, Avatar-Indicator will let you know who’s tweet you’ve just got, and decide whether to check it out right away.
The third unique feature is Direct Link
I think it is obviously the most intuitive and convenient way to open a link. When you want to open a link, just click it in the time line . You can also click a username to open a profile window, click a hash tag to open a search result window. Different kind of links displayed in different colors, you can change it to whatever color you like.
The fourth unique feature is Smart Bookmark
Have you ever experienced this scenario? When you are reading your home timeline, the app notified you that you’ve got some new tweets, you click “go-to-top” button to read the newest tweets, and then you want to get back to the previous position to continue your reading. How can you do this? In other twitter clients you have to scroll down all the way to find where you were, a lot of time wasted. But in this app, “go-to-top” button will appear when you scrolling up, click it, you can got to top, read the newest tweets. After that when you scrolling down, Smart Bookmark button will appear at the corner. Click it, you can get back to exactly where you were.
The fifth unique feature is User Level Notification
Notification for all your new tweets is meaningless, if you following more than a few users, you’ll get new tweets all the time. What if you only want to be notified when someone you most care about posted a new tweet? In this app, it’s easy. You can change your friend’s notification setting directly in his/her profile screen. You can also set different notification ringtone for your friends respectively. So when you heard a notification ringtone, you’ll know who he/she is without the need to open your phone. And you can manage all the enabled User-Level-Notification settings in one place.
Also has most of the basic twitter client features, like post/delete tweets, retweet, retweet with comment, reply, quote, send/delete direct message, subscribe/unsubscribe lists, follow/unfollow user, multiple accounts support, append picture with your tweets, mention auto complete, recent search auto complete, conversation view.
Please give me feedbacks if you have tried it, and I PROMISE to reply all your emails.
1.30-1.36 update:
*Ad-Free.
*3 times faster when launching and loading older tweets.
*Support unlimited accounts rather than 3 accounts.
*Support notifications for all accounts rather than only for the current account.
*Improved mention suggestion feature.

3,es-dense,1000,200,all-MiniLM-L6-v2,5,4,ollama3_1,What is the main difference between the National Sample Survey (NSS) and the India Human Development Survey (IHDS) in terms of measuring India's inequality?,"How unequal is India? The question is simple, the answer is not.
For some 60 years, the only reliable information about India’s inequality was coming from the annual National Sample Survey conducted from 1951. NSS is one of the most venerable surveys in the world of poverty and income distribution statistics. India started fielding it soon after its independence: the survey was supposed to track how the new government fought poverty, to provide information on caste differences, rural-urban gap, caloric intake, especially of the poor and many other statistics. Since its main concern was with poverty, the decision was made to survey consumption, that is, how much people actually consume (do they have sufficient number of calories) rather than income (how many rupees they earn).
For all these decades since 1951 NSS was the key instrument that allowed researchers from India and the rest of the world as well as Indian policymakers to know what is happening with India’s population. India could thus boast to have had a longer series of annual surveys than most rich countries (that often launched their similar surveys in the 1960s). But in addition the survey also benefited from some reflected glory which had to do with the ideals and hopes raised by the Independence and thus it had a bit of this Third World-Bandoeng Summit-Mahalanobis glow always attached to it.
But the problems started in the 1990s when the survey numbers began to diverge more and more from National Accounts statistics: NSS was showing consistently lower rates of growth, and higher poverty than many people thought it should be given India’s fast growth. This led to the famous Great India Poverty debate in which participated Angus Deaton, Amartya Sen, Jean Drèze, T.N. Srinivasan, S. Subramanian, Martin Ravallion and many others. Several representative articles are given here and here and here.
The gap between the slow moving survey mean and much faster changes in per capita GDP was also explained by the failure of NSS to capture top incomes. The top incomes may have been pulling up the mean (presumably reflected in GDP per capita) and if surveys continued, partly by design and partly by the reluctance of the rich to participate, to be focused on the bottom of the income distribution, that could explain the rising gap between NSS and national accounts.
And if indeed that was the reason, or one of the reasons, then another unpleasant conclusion imposed itself: inequality in India may be (far) higher than implied by NSS data.
And indeed, as the graph below shows, NSS kept on producing a fairly stable consumption Gini (calculated here on household per capita basis) over several decades, with only a small increase in inequality after India’s sharp turn toward capitalism in the early 1990s. That Gini, ranging between mid- and higher-30s, made India inequality look about the same as in developed countries.
/>
But until recently we had no other reliable and nationally-representative survey to confront NSS with. Now, thanks to the joint work by University of Maryland and National Council of Applied Research in New Delhi, we have (harmonized by LIS), the first income based surveys of Indian population for 2004 and, just released by LIS, another same survey for 2011.
And the results are very different from NSS’s. First, Indian Gini is remarkably consistent in both 2004 and 2011 and is (on per capita basis) 51 Gini points. This is at the level of Latin American countries and is some 15 points (or almost 40% ) higher than the Gini’s calculated from NSS. Thus a key question is immediately asked: is India’s inequality more like Latin American? NSS was saying for years that it is not; the India Human Development Survey (IHDS) argues it is.
For 2011, I have both micro data from NSS and micro data from IHDS and when I compare income/consumption by each percentile (note that these are entirely different people though), the results do make sense. For the lowest percentiles, consumption is about twice income, and everybody up to the 33rd percentile consumes more than their income (which you would expect in a poor environment). After that point, consumption consistently and monotonically falls short of income (that is, there is saving), so much that among the top 5%, income is twice as high as consumption (saving rate is 50%). Overall, the mean per capita income from IHDS is 47 percent higher than the mean per capita consumption from NSS, and as we have said, Gini is some 15 points higher.
This “reasonableness” of the data, and the absence of discontinuities when comparing income and consumption leads one to believe that it is possible that both NSS and IHDS provide accurate information (with likely underestimation of top-end consumption and income), but that income distribution in India is much more unequally distributed than consumption.
So if we compare India with other countries that use income surveys, this is how it looks (see the figure below). India seems slightly more unequal than Brazil, and more egalitarian than only South Africa.
There are many other issues that are worth exploring here, in particular if we want to look more carefully at the consistency between the two surveys, but I would like to end by considering the role of the new income survey for India from an unusual angle.
As mentioned before, since NSS was the only game in town, all our global poverty and inequality statistics were done using NSS. Now, if we replace NSS with the new income survey as I have done for the global inequality calculation for the year 2011 (unpublished), you may expect that the greater inequality revealed by IHDS would push global inequality up, especially since India is such a populous country. Right?
Wrong.
What happens is that global inequality goes down by approximately 1 Gini point since the higher income levels implied by IHDS push Indians toward the middle of the global income distribution and more than offset the contribution to higher global inequality that comes from the stretched-out Indian distribution. Thus, somewhat paradoxically, a global implication of a new, and I think more reasonable, approach of viewing India as a country with Latin American levels of income inequality is that global inequality, as calculated so far, might have been overestimated.
In conclusion, more unequal but richer India, makes the world more equal.

Round One:
Nelson in his usual Karate style stance keeps out of range of Cummings early strikes. Then he presses into the clinch, but Cummings matches him and they jockey for position. As they break apart Nelson lands a good knee.
Nelson lands a right hook. he misses with an overhand. Nelson very relaxed, but he’s very alert and continually makes Cumming miss by backing up just enough. A right hand counter lands for Nelson, but then Cummings moves to his back and clinches up. Nelson turns though and then breaks away from the clinch.
A head kick is blocked by Cummings. Pace slowed a little now in the final 90 seconds. Cummings leaps in and nelson counters with a punch to the body. More missed shots from Cummings and then he moves into the clinch. Nothing doing and they back up. However, Cummings then comes back in and does finally land a few nice punches while Nelson has his back against the cage. Not for long though as Nelson circles out and that’s the final action of the round.
Round Two:
Nelson biding his time in the opening minute of the second as Cummings continually tries to land strikes, but generally comes up short. however, Cummings does back him up against the cage and unleash a flurry that foces Nelson to clinch.
They stay in the clinch for a while trying to gain an advantage, but it’s stalemate and they disengage. Not much volume in Nelson’s striking so far this round, but he does land a speedy right hand that clearly hits the mark. Certainly better accuracy from him, but a little more offense wouldn’t go astray.
Again he finds a home for a clinical right hand. He starts to close the distance more now, but remains patient and just snaps off another quick right.
Into clinch range and Nelson reaches for a guillotine choke and goes to the mat with it. He fluidly switches on to Cummings back. He lands a few punches and then swiftly locks in a rear-naked choke.
Impressive stuff from Nelson in the way he was able to transition so slickly to his dangerous ground game and he forces Cummings to tap with only twelve seconds of the second round remaining.","['They stay in the clinch for a while trying to gain an advantage, but it’s stalemate and they disengage.

6,es-dense,1000,200,all-MiniLM-L6-v2,5,1,ollama3_1,How did Dan Foley feel about his portrayal on the Survivor TV show?,"Dan Foley: My Survivor Portrayal Was Unfair
The latest castoff expresses his frustration about how he was portrayed on TV
Over a period of three days, multiple cameras film between 300-500 hours of footage. Then, a team of editors boil all that footage down to one 44-minute episode.
Dan Foley, the latest contestant voted off the island, says he watched the first two episodes and realized that he was going to get a villain’s edit. But even he seems surprised at how negatively he was portrayed – and how vitriolic the viewer response has been.
So what did we miss? Foley, a 47-year-old postal worker from Maine, was happy to tell us.
Okay, there are going to be some tough questions today, but let’s start with an easy one: what could you have done differently to keep from going home?
You know, it’s easy to be an armchair quarterback. If I had only known that Carolyn had the immunity idol, I would have voted out Sierra.
You used your extra vote during the tribal council. Do you think that made you a target?
I said it before: superfans can’t do basic math. It made no sense for me to play that vote when there was an odd number of people left. I wanted to play it when there was an even number. And what you didn’t see was that Sierra came to me and said that Will was ready to get rid of me. And then during Tribal Council, Will said, “If Dan has the advantage, he should use it.” It was the right time to play it.
Fair enough. So what was your reaction when you were voted out? Were you angry at Carolyn?
Look, anyone who walks out of the game with a smile on their face didn’t play the game. I left that game with a fever of expletives. They didn’t show it, but I was swearing and spitting and seething after my torch was snuffed. I was absolutely furious, calling Mike every name in the book. But I don’t wish anyone ill will.
Okay, I need to call you out on your statement that flippers never win.
They don’t.
They do.
No they don’t. Tony Vlachos was a backstabber, not a flipper.
Okay, but Vecepia Towery won season 4 and she flipped twice. She flipped to vote out Boston Rob at Final 10. Then, at Final 9, she flipped back and took out the Rotu alliance.
But did she win?
Yes. She won the million. She beat Neleh Dennis.
Huh. Okay.
And Sandra Diaz Twine flipped multiple times to win.
Well, Sandra is a different case altogether. But Cochran flipped, and did that work for him?
No. No one says that all flippers don’t win. But flippers can and do win. Also, there was Danni Boatwright in Guatemala…
(Laughs) Yes, she played a good game. But I still believe that flippers don’t win. I really do.
Okay, let’s move on to the ugliness of the season. Your character was very difficult to root for.
I talked to Jeff Probst the other day and I ripped him a new one. I said, “You did me wrong. You did me dirty. You screwed me on my edit. You made me look like a piece of s—.” And Jeff said, “How do you figure?” And I said, “You cherry-picked things to show, sometimes out of context.”
Get a Tour of Jeff Probst’s ‘Spectacular’ Pad
I don’t know you. I only know the edited version of you. Are you saying that it was incorrect?When I am pushed, I push back. And I was pushed a lot. They didn’t show that. Lindsey, Sierra … they said things to me and pushed back. Look, I was always the fat guy. I learned how to stand up for myself. But you didn’t see what other people were saying or doing.
You took a lot of heat for your comments to Shirin.
Look, there’s not a single person on this season who didn’t say derogatory things about Shirin. Even Mike called her a man-hater. I made an unfortunate comment about slapping her. I had no idea about her past. None. Zero. I would never have made that comment. I apologize for saying it.
But at the same time, my comment was not meant literally. I meant it figuratively. How many times do you hear people say, “I could kill him.” Are they really plotting to kill someone? Of course not.
So where do things stand with Shirin now?
The truth of the matter is that we don’t get along. I don’t wish her ill or badly, and I hope nothing but the best for her. I hope that if she wants to go back on Survivor again, she gets that shot. There are things in her past that continue to haunt her to this day, and I hope that she gets the help that she clearly needs.
You were a big Survivor fan. Now that your reputation has taken a hit, are you still a fan of the show?
My reputation has not been harmed. The people who know me know that my edit was not who I really am. I don’t have a problem telling the truth. There are people who love me, and people who hate me. There is no real middle ground. the people who hate me can’t handle the truth.
But do you still love the show, or has your view been tainted?
How can you not have a tainted vision when you pull back the curtain and see that Oz is pulling on the levers? I’m a little disappointed, but I still love the show. Would I play it again? (Long Pause) Yeah. In a second.","['Dan Foley: My Survivor Portrayal Was Unfair\nThe latest castoff expresses his frustration about how he was portrayed on TV\nOver a period of three days, multiple cameras film between 300-500 hours of footage.

We have a quiet week as far as making dinner because we have lots of fun social plans, so we’re going to post a few lunch recipes too, just to keep things interesting.
We went to the Yankee game Sunday afternoon with our friends Jeff and Marie. As per usual, we ate our share of fun ballpark food, so we’ll have a little snack at most for dinner.
While Kim has a meeting at the New York Junior League on Monday, Tony will be out for dinner with his buddies, so Kim will be on her own once she gets home. While our dinner plans are different, we’ll probably have the same thing for lunch: The New York Times’ Green Garlic Tabbouleh. Kim made tabbouleh a few weeks go, but this recipes gives things a fun twist by using spring garlic, which is in season right now, but not for much longer.
Kim is going to a lecture Tuesday night and Tony will probably end up working late, so we’ll either meet up somewhere for dinner or just meet at home and order in. On Wednesday, Tony will be having dinner at a work event, so Kim will be on her own. Again, different dinners, same lunch, in this case The Minimalist Baker’s 30-Minute Portobello Mushroom Stir Fry. We’ve found that despite Lent being long over, we’re still skewing pretty vegetarian/pescatarian, and this dish fits the bill, though Tony may add a little chicken to it to mix things up.
Kim will be back at the New York Junior League on Thursday, so Tony will be on his own for dinner. On Friday, we’re going to an event organized by Tony’s university alumni organization: an exhibit of the works of Robert Ryman to be held at the Dia:Chelsea on West 22nd Street. We’ve had a lot of fun at previous alumni events, so we’re looking forward to this one. We’ll probably grab dinner somewhere near the gallery.
We have tickets to the ballet on Saturday, but will probably have dinner at home in the form of Food 52’s Cilantro Lime Salmon Cakes with Chipotle Mayo. If you’ve been following our blog for the past few weeks, you might notice that this is the third time we’ve had the recipe on our weekly menu.

I kind of felt this coming, so I'm not very surprised at all. Been hooked on this site since 2006/2007 but have kind of felt the general enthusiasm in your writing drop in the last half of this year. Really glad though that you let the year run to an end before putting the site to sleep. No need to drag it any longer if it's more of a chore than a joy.
Can't thank you enough for keeping this site running with new entries every friday. You know how to keep your readers and listen to them. ;) Musically, it has been an eye-opener into so much exciting stuff. Personally, it's been a very healthy road to follow and a sanctuary in the Internet chaos.
Looking forward to some action on the new site!
Cheers!

As a memorial, I'd love to see a list of the Top-however-many albums since starting the site -- 1996-2008 yes?
Sure, if we see ratings as immutable we could more or less do this ourselves, but I'm interested in how things have changed; would OKC and Agaetis Byrjun still top the list? What have you discovered long after its time?
This site has been a regular visit of mine since ... 2003 maybe? and it's been delightful to see how hard you work to promote bands that might not otherwise get noticed by anyone. At the same time, I absolutely see how the numerical rating bell curve can grow exhausting -- music writing was made to instill pleasure, to be a sprawling manifesto, to be something you want to do. I find if I can write at length about anything, I inevitably end up liking even the things that I might have reservations about. I really look forward to seeing where you go from here. Best!

As much as you’d like to think that you can handle your love and relationship problems on your own like a champ, it never hurts to get advice (or even an entirely different perspective) from people who have already been there, done that, and set up an appropriately themed podcast to talk about it.
But with the sheer number of love and relationship podcasts out there, you just can’t help but wonder: Which ones among them should you be listening to?
And frankly, does it even matter?
Seriously, how many different ways can people actually talk about such a universal and all-encompassing emotion as love?
As it turns out, quite a lot — and these five love and relationship podcasts are among the best and most unique ones out there.
Love Is Like A Plant with Sarah May Bates and Ellen Huerta
What do you get when you combine two experts on love and heartbreak in one podcast? An informative and in-depth conversation about planting the seeds of love in your life and making it last, no matter what kinds of challenges come your way.
Ellen Huerta, the creator of break-up support app Mend, teams up with Sarah May Bates, the self-improvement and emotional coping guru, on Love is Like a Plant. This one-of-a-kind podcast revolves around a single question: “If love is like a plant, how does one keep it alive?”
From defining a relationship to dealing with how to end it, Ellen and Sarah take listeners through a wide spectrum of love, sex, dating, and break-up advice, offering helpful advice and witty commentary along the way.
Relationships! Let’s Talk About It with Pripo Teplitsky
Relationships aren’t just about love or sex. From the way we talk to our siblings to how we cope with a dear friend who’s moving away, interpersonal relationships are rife with so many little issues and particulars that we sometimes get lost in the shuffle and forget the things that really matter.
Those small yet significant things are what psychotherapist and professional marriage and couples counselor Pripo Teplitsky tackles in each episode of Relationships! Let’s Talk About It. Pripo often has guests on his show with very interesting stories to tell.
Whether it’s a problem with your best buddy, your parents, your neighbor, or even your roommate, Pripo’s more than happy to talk about it—and even talk you through it.
Unqualified with Anna Faris
Some would look at a celebrity and wonder what a person who probably has everything she wants could ever offer in terms of relationship advice. After all, life’s generally a smooth cruise for these superstar types, right?
Actress, model, and author Anna Faris smashes that stereotype and serves up some delightful nuggets of wisdom in the amusingly titled podcast, Unqualified.
Anna features celebrity guests on her show, and asks about their personal lives in a way that’s both thorough and respectful. She’s also refreshingly open and honest, and is quite adept at keeping the mood fun without losing the emotions behind each story shared on the podcast.
Confessions of a Terrible Husband with Nick Pavlidis
The image of a husband in the proverbial doghouse, forced to spend the night lying on the living room sofa instead of beside his wife, is often played for laughs in pop culture. Author and motivational coach Nick Pavlidis, however, uses that mental image to deliver wise, honest, and hilariously self-deprecating stories revolving around the point when he realized that he was far from the ideal husband he’d thought himself to be.
Nick tackles an assortment of marital problems with the ease and expertise of a man who has spent one too many nights on a lumpy couch (and isn’t ashamed to admit it). On Confessions of a Terrible Husband: Lessons Learned from a Lumpy Couch, he shares his stumbles and challenges as a husband (which he jestingly calls “moron purgatory”), infused with advice from qualified relationship experts.
And yes, he will gladly help you pronounce his last name properly.
Savage Lovecast with Dan Savage
The name of this podcast works on so many levels. Not only does author and public speaker Dan Savage host the Savage Lovecast, but the subjects it deals with are also… savage, for lack of a better word.
Since 2006, Dan has been dishing out real talk on dating, sex, and love (even way before #realtalk or podcasts were a thing).
Whether it’s standard relationship stuff or more taboo topics that would make your parents and grandparents blush, Dan’s definitely got something substantial to say, delivered in an unapologetic and entertaining manner.

10,es-dense,1000,200,all-MiniLM-L6-v2,5,1,ollama3_1,Which two teams dropped out of the Primal Quest Utah race and what were their reasons for doing so?,"Primal Quest Utah has now entered its third day. Over the race's first two days, the 365 athletes from 20 nations have competed in temperatures reaching 104 degrees, riding horses, mountain bikes, and riverboards in the Green River, trekking across the desert, and hiking through Utah's notorious slot canyons. The lead teams have covered roughly 200 miles; the teams at the back of the field are more than 75 miles behind. Gordon Wright sends us this from the race course.
This year's Primal Quest is so hot, so hard, and so long that race organizers have been largely concerned with what could go wrong. While heat stroke, dehydration and horseback riding injuries are relatively rare in most adventure races, they are real concerns in this one, as well as the more common issues such as injuries, exhaustion and logistical challenges.
This anxiety has been largely mitigated by the fitness of the competitors and the planning of the race staff. Astonishingly, only two teams have dropped out: Team Utah and Team xxTreme US. Both drop-outs bring surprises: Team Utah would seem to have a home-town advantage, but quit due to blisters and exhaustion. Team xxTreme US is largely comprised of Navy SEALs — notably hard men who were undone by injury.
""I don't think you could reasonably take 400 people off the streets — or even out of a gym — stick them in the desert for two days and expect them to survive,"" said Primal Quest Course Director Don Mann. ""But these athletes are so fit they're not only surviving but making good progress.""
Amid all the concern over the extraordinary heat and the capriciousness of the horses, a race broke out. Four teams ran and paddled neck and neck all throughout Day Two, never getting separated by more than twelve minutes. Among the leaders is Team Nike/Powerblast, the odds-on favorite led by defending champions Mike Kloser and Ian Adamson. Two teams led by women are also among the leaders: Team Merrill/Wigwam, captained by Robyn Benincasa and Team Spyder, captained by Danelle Ballangee.
What makes that top grouping interesting isn't just that they're led by women, but that Benincasa and Ballangee are former teammates of Kloser and Adamson. The reasons for Ballangee and Benincasa leaving their male teammates and starting their own teams are many, and while the racers proffer respect, hard feelings remain.
There is still more than 200 miles of racing to go - and the lead teams have logged only four to six hours sleep in more than three days. But what is clear is that the ghosts of teammates past are dogging Team Nike, and it doesn't look like they're going away any time soon.
Farther back in the pack, the pace was more stately, and the camaraderie much more present. Team Pedro's Boulders was preparing to launch its kayaks into the Green River for 35-mile paddling leg when field correspondent Bob Heady caught up to them.
Iona MacKenzie was stuffing her backpack into her kayak's hatch and painfully recalling Sunday's horseback section. Her horse stepped on her foot and broke a toe; she didn't realize the seriousness of the injury until the beginning of the eight-mile riverboarding segment. She was 108 miles into the race, and she couldn't pull her swim fin on.
MacKenzie's teammate Charlie Kharsa gave her one of his fins, which was a couple of sizes bigger, and that ""solved"" MacKenzie's problem.
Kharsa now had one fin that was two sizes smaller than his foot, but if anyone in the race could shrug it off, it's Kharsa, who several years ago completed a riverboard voyage down the length of the Grand Canyon on the Colorado River.
Team Semper Fi was also transitioning from riverboard to kayak. A group of U.S. Marine officers, the team has already made a large impression on the race. Blowing away stereotypes, the Marines are far from taciturn and decidedly not buttoned-up. In fact, they seem to be having a blast amid all the misery. One of the team members entered the riverboarding segment by tossing his board into the Green, sprinting down the beach, and hopping onto it for an impressive display of skim-boarding.
Brian Chontosh, who was awarded the Navy Cross for valor in Iraq in 2003, is reveling in a challenge that doesn't involve being shot at. Chontosh and teammate Kevin Saunders are both captains, and therefore lower-ranked than married team members Majors Sarah Fullwood and James Fullwood. When asked whether or not he and Saunders were getting along with their superiors, Chontosh joked, ""We don't want to be anywhere near them — Kevin and I paddle together and plot against them.""
This joking, fun-loving attitude has become a trademark for a group of competitors who, despite the gravity of their occupation, do not take themselves seriously. Chontosh also asked Heady to send a message to front-running Team Nike/Powerblast, ""We've been taking it easy for a couple of days — and we're about to put the hammer down.""
The merry Marines paddled away, 62 miles behind Nike, but with tremendous spirit.
Semper Fi.

Instead of crafting a quick story for a Wednesday’s Word post, I searched for a quote that might give color to the word. I found one that indirectly speaks to my desire to write and the courage it takes to keep me writing, even when the inspiration flickers out.
Today’s word:
quantum. noun.
1. A quantity or amount.
2. A portion.
3. A large amount.
4. The smallest amount of something that can exist independently.
, American business owner, career counselor, author.
A new year approaches. And,2010 calls for fresh goals but demands repeat determination.
Don’t just imagine, Someday I’d like to be a writer.
Write.
Because “anything worth doing is worth doing…” now.
Interesting that you consider it courageous to keep writing even when you’re not inspired. I’ve never thought of writing as courageous … well, not fiction writing. I want to know more of your viewpoint.
I read that quote and immediately thought about the risk in writing.
For years I wanted to call myself a writer; I wanted to take the plunge. But I never ventured outside of my journal or a few personal letters that recounted a silly experience.
Starting a blog was taking a risk. Submitting my first piece (in it’s own infancy) was taking a risk.
It would be easy to imagine the smile on my face when that first novel is finished and published, instead of actually rewriting that novel to submittable quality. And, then sending it out into the query world.
And, I thought of your recent post (), and how even when I feel uninspired or unrecognized (with just one more rejection email to archive), I still write.
I’m in a weird mood, I guess, or maybe I’m completely missing your point, but I’m not being flippant.
Is what you feel you’re risking only the rejection of your work? I know it’s hard not to feel like a conjoined twin with your writing, but I’ve finally accepted that agents and editors are just businessmen and my work is only a product to them.
I realize, of course, for a writer who has to make a living from her writing, selling the product is extremely important. I don’t have to sell my work, so I’ve come to the point where I view the act of writing, the creation of story, as the valuable part … not the selling. So, in that sense, writing is not a risk to me.
I would like to share it, and so I will try to sell it, but if I never succeed, it does not diminish the accomplishment of writing a novel (or story), nor does that make me enjoy my work less.
I don’t think you’re being flippant. Maybe I’m not expressing myself well.
For me, the risk in writing comes in the act itself: to write is to make myself vulnerable, whether I write memoir or fiction, since each story I write reveals a small part of myself or my psyche.
The risk also comes in sharing that story (and that small piece of myself) with others, whether they pay to read it or not.
I hope that reads more clear than my first comment.
Ha ha, you were clear. I was trying to let you know I didn’t want you to think I was being flippant in the comment I was about to make.
I guess a year ago I felt like you. I’ve had enough experience in critique groups now that I don’t think of it as a risk to share my work. But I think I feel more separated from my work than you do.
Christi, I also feel the act of writing takes courage. For me, writing (including fiction writing) is often a painful, fearful experience. What I fear isn’t so much that others will reject me but that I will reject the parts of myself exposed in the writing process.
To be honest, I never thought, Someday I’d like to be a writer. Instead, I thought, Someday I’d like to stop lying to myself. A tiny part of my psyche decided years ago that I’m writer, so now I try to earn the right to say so aloud.
“2010 calls for fresh goals but demands repeat determination.” Yes, and I like the clarity in this statement.
Ann, I love this: A tiny part of my psyche decided years ago that I’m writer, so now I try to earn the right to say so aloud.
Earning the right to say so aloud hits home with me.

In yet another curtsy to the politically correct orthodoxy, President Barack Obama’s.
And the purge of training material regarding Islamic terrorism from law enforcement training is only the beginning. Attorney General Eric Holder told Congress that anti-Muslim instructional materials hurt the country’s fight against terrorist groups like al-Qaeda. As a result of this mentality, the Joint Chiefs of Staff were asked to collect counterterrorism training materials at all military academies and academic centers such as the National Defense Intelligence College and the U.S. Army Combined Arms Center.
“The goal, evidently, is to banish any material that could be viewed as offensive to Muslims,” said the JW blog.
To fulfill this politically-correct mission, the FBI enlisted the Army Combating Terrorism Center at West Point to purge material that conflates terrorism with mainstream Islam, according to inside information cited in the Judicial Watch — arguably one of the most sympathetic lawmakers to Islamic causes — the event came in “response to the spike in anti-Muslim bigotry” and marked the first ever congressional hearing on Muslim civil rights.
It was Durbin who on the floor of the Senate in 2004 called U.S. soldiers Nazis, and detention centers such as Guantanamo Bay “gulags.” He later apologized, but his constituents were happy to hear him denigrating U.S. troops since his district has a very large Muslim population, according to news reports.
According to the Examiner, other Muslim outreach efforts under Obama included; Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano meeting to discuss national security matters with a group of extremist Muslim organizations including members of the Muslim Brotherhood, the nation’s space agency (NASA) being ordered to focus on Muslim diplomacy, and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton signing a special order to allow the reentry of two radical Islamic academics whose terrorist ties long banned them from the U.S.","['By Jim Kouri\nIn yet another curtsy to the politically correct orthodoxy, President Barack Obama’s.\nAnd the purge of training material regarding Islamic terrorism from law enforcement training is only the beginning.

Morganite is a pastel-coloured crystal, found in subtle shades of pink, lilac pink and salmon pink. It is usual for these gems to be light in colour, even though some are known to exhibit rich tones. It is a variety of the mineral beryl that also includes emerald and aquamarine.
Morganite was discovered in the early 1900’s in California and thereafter in Madagascar. Known initially as pink beryl, the crystal was renamed morganite in recognition of the financier and gem collector J.P. Morgan. The gem is also known as ‘pink emerald’ and ‘rose beryl’.
These stones are comparatively free of inclusions. The availability of huge Morganite rough allows for the possibility of large faceted crystals. The Brazilian stones can weigh more than ten kilograms.
Metaphysical Meaning
Morganite crystals have been linked to the heart
As a result of its subtle tone of pink, morganite crystals have been linked to the heart. For this reason, morganite rings serve excellently as engagement rings. It has been referred to as the Crystal of Eternal Love.
The vibrationsof morganite subtly heals the heart and opens it to unconditional love, repressed feelings and emotional needs that have not been fulfilled.
Morganite’s energy is also linked to the love of the Heavenly, teaching us that we are all linked to a Universal Heart and form part of a broader design.
Morganite is a symbol of beauty
Morganite crystals are great symbols of beauty. They help one to see the beautiful things in life, the energies of which one could absorb into oneself. The love energy of morganite is said to make its wearer more beautiful both mentally and physically.
The gem with exceptional powers
Gemstones of the beryl group have exceptional powers, which means that the properties of Morganite are superior. These crystals are known to aid further in other aspects of spiritual advancement.
Allow the Crystal of Eternal Love to work its magic for you
The vibration of love provoked by Morganite is extremely powerful. As long as the crystal is within your aura, it has an opportunity to work its magic.
So, treat yourself from the remarkable collection of morganite designs from Eldorado Diamonds. Designs that have been specifically selected to deliver to its wearer strong heart-centred energy.

ORANGE Magazine
ORANGE, UT's student magazine, gives students a hands-on approach to magazine publication. The staff works on all sides of a magazine from advertising to editorial, production to writing, and finances to public relations. After working on ORANGE, the staff leaves with a strong portfolio and enough experience to tackle any one of New York's leading titles.
The Magazine Club (MAG)
The MAG Club in the School of Journalism is designed for those interested in a career in magazines. The club is a great place to begin, a low-pressure way to get your feet wet --- much more social than work!
Scheduled meetings are held each semester, usually once every three weeks with local professionals to discuss their experience in the field, bring in local magazine editors, often our own graduates to discuss magazine careers, and keep a running list of the latest internships and possible jobs.
MAG is one of the few UT Sponsored Organizations on campus, so it is much more than just a ""club."" We also have a working relationship with ED on Campus, the national college magazine club, founded by NYC magazine editors. We will show you how to tie into their national job bank and intern listings.
MAG can also help you, at an early stage here, gain valuable hands-on experience with ORANGE, the campus magazine produced by School of Journalism students. But most importantly, we are just a group of people all working together to achieve success in the magazine industry!
MAG also looks great on the resume. Check the display box for MAG (and ORANGE) on the 6th floor of the College of Communication Building) for more details.

20,es-dense,1000,200,all-MiniLM-L6-v2,5,1,ollama3_1,What are some of the guidelines for disciplining a teenager?,"In the light of all the discussion about disciplining your child that the NFL has created, I think this is a good time to talk about how to discipline teenagers, since it is very different from how you would discipline a young child.
When disciplining a teenager you need to remember that the actions that you take when your child breaks the rules are actions that will hopefully help your child learn. Parents question how much “rope” to give a child, worrying that there might be too much, and the child will “hang himself.” Other parent’s worry that being too strict will result in their teen rebelling, losing respect, and not loving them. Others consider rebellion and defiance to be “normal” in teenagers and thus may rarely take a teen’s misbehavior seriously. While to some degree rebellion and defiance are natural, it has been found that excessive rebellion and excessive defiance are usually indicators of an oppositional defiant behavior disorder and are not necessarily associated with health.
The problem is that most parents only have the model of discipline that was meted out to them as children and teens. For many, identification with the normal rebellious and defiant aspects of the teenage years has never been normalized by mature growth; thus they either subtly (or not so subtly) stimulate “bad behavior,” only to follow it, in their own anxiety and confusion, by administering punishment to the adolescent. Not surprisingly, this causes the teen perplexity, anxiety, and confusion.
On the other hand, constructive discipline tends to result in the development of a mature young adult by the end of the adolescent passage. It helps a teenager control his impulses, cooperate with other people, and be patient. The aim of discipline should not be to develop a homogenized and completely socialized teenager; parents should always stress the uniqueness of their teenage sons and daughters. Rather, discipline should result in a teen taking a wholehearted and responsible approach to life. Disciplining a teenager is different from disciplining a younger child since the teenager is more mature, more reflective, and more able to enter into discussions and negotiations. This means that discipline can and should always be enlightening to teenagers, never a means of deriding, shaming, or making them feel as if they are “bad.”
What to Do
- Don’t be a cruel parent. Don’t humiliate, criticize destructively, physically attack, or try to cripple your teenagers will just in order to make him conform to certain rules.
- Make expectations and rules clear to your child.
- Don’t be scared to set limits.
- Do not make rules arbitrarily, even if you feel strong about them; they should involve some give and take.
- Understand that whatever teaching and disciplining you do, most teenagers will mature through trial and error.
- Reward constructive behavior rather than criticize bad behavior.
- Be a role model for your teenager.
- Be compassionate and patient when it comes to discussion of family rules and responsibilities.
- When punishing your teenager it is best to withdraw privileges. However, make sure to not over-punish because you are angry.
- Never use physical or mental torture.
- Don’t give in to tantrums or loud and intimidating behavior, and don’t allow guilt to cloud your judgment.
- Remember, teenagers test the limits. You will be tested!
In the end, be compassionate and empathetic and remember what it was like to be a teenager. Your greatest influence on your child doesn’t come through your punishment but through your being a good role model and your ability to understand the situation and act appropriately..","['What to Do\n- Don’t be a cruel parent.

21,es-dense,1000,200,all-MiniLM-L6-v2,5,2,ollama3_1,What is the purpose of the Virginia Environmental Education Certification program?,"The Virginia Environmental Education Certification program will officially launch January 3, 2022!
Designed with both formal and nonformal educators in mind, the Virginia Environmental Education Certification program sets a statewide standard for exemplary environmental education practice, encourages exploration of environmental education resources, and promotes professional growth. This certification program is relevant for anyone who educates about an aspect of the environment, would like to strengthen their environmental or pedagogical expertise, and is passionate about professionalism in environmental education.
It has been developed with the North American Association for Environmental Education (NAAEE) accreditation program in mind. That means you can trust in the quality of materials and the learning process of the program, and once accredited, your certification will be transferable to any state with an NAAEE accredited program.
_____________________________________________________
From NAAEE: ""Professional certification ensures that individuals are fully prepared for work within a specific field of expertise. Certified environmental educators meet stringent requirements for proficiency in both the interdisciplinary content and pedagogy necessary to develop and deliver high quality, effective EE programs.
While it is not necessary to attain certification in order to be employed as an environmental educator, certification readily distinguishes highly qualified professionals and enhances the resumes of those who have attained it. Having a community of certified professionals also elevates respect for the profession.""

The VAEE would like to extend its heart-felt thanks to the volunteers who serve on the Certification Advisory Board (CAB) for their dedication to carrying the dream of a Virginia EE Certification program forward. Certification program development was begun by the Virginia Office of Environmental Education, but when it was closed in 2016, the VAEE chose to continue this work. A couple of intrepid volunteers kept the process going, and soon the CAB was formed and started on the path to making Virginia EE Certification a reality.","['The Virginia Environmental Education Certification program will officially launch January 3, 2022!\nDesigned with both formal and nonformal educators in mind, the Virginia Environmental Education Certification program sets a statewide standard for exemplary environmental education practice, encourages exploration of environmental education resources, and promotes professional growth.

These sites continue to be meaningful to Native peoples and are considered sacred to those whose tribes were forced from Ohio long ago. These monumental works of archaeoastronomy and landscape architecture bear remarkable testimony to the multifaceted genius of aboriginal North Americans in the Ohio Valley and to an artistic and cultural flowering that had significant impacts all across the continent between 900 and 2,600 years ago. Inscription on the World Heritage List would underscore the cultural significance of these sites and call international attention to these treasures long known to Ohioans.

The U.S. Department of the Interior and the National Park Service control and guide the process that culminates in a nomination of these sites to UNESCO – the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization – which administers the World Heritage List.
Currently the – Fort Ancient in Warren County, the Newark Earthworks in Licking County, and the earthworks included in the Hopewell Culture National Historical Park in Ross County.
The Need for Support
A working group of archaeologists, anthropologists, architects, cultural landscape historians, museum and park administrators, and Native Americans are collaborating to complete a draft of this document for review by the National Park Service before a final submission can be made to UNESCO. Funding is needed to continue the progress toward the completion of the draft nomination: consulting with other World Heritage sites and nominee organizations and other experts; performing additional research; compiling all required data; formulating required management plans; developing economic impact studies, and designing the draft document. The experience of other successful U.S. and international applicants for inscription indicates that preparation of the nomination requires at least one full time staff person and – in addition to the contributions of the working group - the services of various consultants, researchers, photographers, graphic designers, and editors. Therefore, we estimate that an investment of between $800,000 and $1,200,000 may be necessary to document the significance of our sites and how they will be managed, in a comprehensive and appropriate manner designed to elicit favorable consideration by UNESCO.

 'As masterpieces of human creative genius, the Ancient Ohio Earthworks are treasures whose relevance is worldwide and whose significance equals that of the Acropolis, the Pyramids, Stonehenge and other icons of human culture. These sites continue to be meaningful to Native peoples and are considered sacred to those whose tribes were forced from Ohio long ago. These monumental works of archaeoastronomy and landscape architecture bear remarkable testimony to the multifaceted genius of aboriginal North Americans in the Ohio Valley and to an artistic and cultural flowering that had significant impacts all across the continent between 900 and 2,600 years ago.

to raise £40,000 in 40 days, our fabulous new village
hall was opened. Find out more about this remarkable journey
to keep the 100-year-old building at the heart of our community,
and ready for another century of work.
While it may have been a big achievement from the outset,
it was one which received overwhelming and essential
support from a number of trust funds, including the Big Lottery
in Scotland.
It's a remarkable achievement after 15 years of work for
a group of dedicated volunteers who have remained committed
to dragging the historic building and community amenity firmly
into the 21st century. In the words of the committee, a 'new
and exciting facility' has been created to replace the 'much-loved
but decrepit building' that has in the past excluded a proportion
of the community due to its lack of modern-day amenities.
The transformation of the hall into a vibrant, multi-activity
centre for the whole community is now no longer a pipedream.
The entire project didn't come cheap, however. But thanks
to an extensive round of fundraising initiatives, such as
music nights and raffles and donations from a number of local
and national funds, and drawing on the infallible enthusiasm
and commitment for the regeneration project to succeed, work
started on site in the summer of 2007. This was in no small way
due to the amazing, worldwide response to an 11th hour appeal
to raise a spectacular £40,000
in 40 Days by the deadline of 30th June.
To all those who donated to the £40,000 in 40 Days Appeal - thank you! We couldn't have done it without you.

Hello everyone,
I have a question about CAN interface PXI-8512. I have two chassis with PXIe 8880 controllers and with PXI-8512 interface modules.
I need to exchange data between those two PXI 8880 controllers and the question is if I can use PXI-8512 modules to send and receive data with CAN protocol? The data is from third part custom device (vehicle simulator). If it is not possible, how can I exchange data between two controllers?
Thank you for answer.
05-10-2017 05:34 AM
Hello krzesniak1,
the direct answer to your question is yes, you can use CAN to share data between your controllers.
In my opinion it is not the best way though. If the controllers are networked, you can use shared variables (network-published) as explained in this white paper:
THis will give you a smoother programming experience and more flexibility than CAN. Obviously, it may be better to use CAN if you want this data to be a part of a bigger system that uses this communication protocol.
As an unrelated tip, it is best to think of PXI controllers as computers, so you can use any way of communication you would normally use between two computers (TCP, ftp, UDP etc.)
Best Regards,
Nick

Thank you for your advice. However I also use VeriStand to deploy a project and I am not sure how to use a shared variables with VeriStand. I also tried with udp communication, however I did not succeed.
Do you know may be an example where communication between two PXIs is well explained?

Roberto Alagna – My Life Is An Opera (2014)
FLAC (tracks) 24-bit/96 kHz | Time – 00:57:23 minutes | 1,05 GB | Genre: Classical, Opera
Studio Master, Official Digital Download – Source: prestoclassical.co.uk | © Deutsche Grammophon
Recorded: AIR Studios (Londres) du 1er au 6 septembre 2014 et à Abbey Road Studios (Londres) le 8 Septembre 2014
Roberto Alagna is THE most well-known French tenor worldwide, with 30 years of career on stage, and 60 opera roles in his repertoire. For this all-new album, he sings selections both familiar and less well-known as well as duets with soprano Aleksandra Kurzak. Highlghts include selections from I Pagliacci, Manon Lescaut, Madama Butterfly, Roberto Devereux and many more.
A cynic might look at Roberto Alagna’s new disc, ‘My Life is an Opera’, and think, ‘At least he admits it’. From his stormy La Scala stage departure to his relationship with Angela Gheorghiu, Alagna’s personal life is…well, operatic. Somewhat embarrassingly, the disc’s booklet has each of the arias listed (out of order from their disc sequencing) to illustrate some signpost in his life, though instead of dealing with the aforementioned incidents in this loose autobiography, the text speaks of the ‘meteoric’ rise of this ‘golden-voiced handsome young genius’. (Oh dear.)
But anyone who thought the medium-weight Alagna voice was on the way out with his Radamès and Otello might be dumbfounded at his excellent state of vocal health on the disc, and the sure dramatic instincts behind it. Most of the repertoire seems new to Alagna’s discography, though there are very few signs of having just learnt arias from Gluck’s Orfeo, The Queen of Sheba (both the Gounod and Goldmark versions) and Reyer’s Sigurd.
Aside from forays into Puccini’s Manon Lescaut and Leoncavallo’s Pagliacci, the programme seems to signify a re-commitment to his fundamentally mid-weight lyric vocal personality, not playing safe in the way he builds phrases and longer-term musical climaxes but rarely pushing his limits (the closest he comes is in an excerpt from his brother David Alagna’s opera Le dernier jour d’un condamné ). Lensky’s aria from Eugene Onegin is in French translation, not Russian. Bel canto choices such as the dramatically charged duet from Roberto Devereux (with Aleksandra Kurzak) don’t require serious coloratura.
The biggest vocal surprise is ‘Magische Töne’ from the Goldmark Sheba, in which Alagna goes into the falsetto stratosphere with a musico-dramatic effect that stands well alongside performances by the great tenors of the past, including Nicolai Gedda and Leo Slezak. Alagna doesn’t have a particularly strong-minded collaborator in the London Orchestra (an ensemble I’ve never heard of) and its Director Yvan Cassar. But recorded sound is first-class. –David Patrick Stearns, Gramophone

With the start of a new school year coming up, teachers are tasked with creating a meaningful learning experience for their deaf and hard of hearing students for the upcoming year. Doing this while navigating Coronavirus is especially challenging. Many have been asked to plan for a semester that accommodates hybrid learning or the flexibility of transitioning from in-person to digital learning at a moment’s notice.
This coming Fall, a teacher’s responsibilities will extend far beyond restructuring their curricula. We know that teachers have an important impact on a child’s mental/physical health, social well being, and more. With everything that our students have been dealing with since March, this impact is more important than ever. Balancing all of these responsibilities, with new school guidelines, in addition to protecting their own health is a lot for one person to handle.
We at CSD Learns want to ease that burden.
CSD Learns STEM Toolkits Are the Adaptable Resources You Need
We have worked with subject matter experts to create a series of STEM Teacher’s Toolkits to use in elementary, middle, and high school. These toolkits are easy to implement online, in-person – or both simultaneously.
Featuring deaf and hard of hearing role models, each toolkit provides educators with several weeks’ worth of lessons (in ASL) that students will love. Each free toolkit has videos, interactive activities, quizzes and more. Keep reading to find the perfect toolkit for your classroom.
Teach Your Middle Schoolers to Stay Safe Online
With our students spending so much time online –even more now with virtual learning – it’s important they know how to stay safe.
Our Developing Your Cybersense Toolkits, created in partnership with RIT/NTID, provide you with four weeks of lessons on cybersecurity. Your students will learn about topics like information security, digital footprints, social media use, and fake news from four deaf and hard of hearing role models.
Inspire your High Schoolers to Pursue a Career in STEM
Did you know that deaf and hard of hearing workers who pursue STEM careers earn up to 30% more than deaf workers in non-STEM careers? In addition to that, STEM careers are projected to grow by nearly 9% over the next eight years. It’s the perfect time to be encouraging students to pursue and education in STEM.
Our “Immersion in STEM” series highlights careers in four different areas of STEM; immunology, nanoengineering, programming, and statistics. Your high schoolers will learn about what it takes to have a successful career in STEM from four pros who’ve been there before!
Pique Your Elementary Students’ Interest in STEM
It’s never too early for your students to start learning about their immune system, how their computers work, why math is important, what goes into the technology they use every day – and more.

this is so so so so so lovely
GOSH this is incredibly gorgeous, I’ve always loved the palace as a local but this shoot is drool worthy! Would have loved if they featured the grounds a bit more. Stunning
FABULOUSLY DONE, the cakes r the best of all 4 me followed by the decorations n settings. Overall, its really beautiful.
Very nice and clear picture …… Thumbs up to Mr Alakija again
The only down side, the wedding gowns are so outdated and not trendy ……. Hardly any of the wedding dresses made me say “awwwwwww”
The wedding gowns are in the 90 s so i am a bit confused as this is 2013 …. Those gowns are at best HIDEOUS and take away from the wonderful skills of the photographer. As in seriously who will wear those gowns now for their wedding . The styles are very outdated
Thot I was the only one not seeing “the light”
My sista May God bless you!!!!
The dresses are sooooooo… ugly it is unbelievable. The deco is great, but that’s because it’s in hand and the venue is beautiful.
The cakes are just okay, the gold trimmings on the cake are not smooth, could be better. A little OTT for me.
omg, thought it was just me. worst dresses ever!
This will make you wanna spend money.Classy, Royal, Splendid.
Always fabulous work when it comes to these guys, they are masters of their craft. Inspiration mode activates. Those table layouts are just mwah!
Please apart from the wedding cakes, the dessert table which were certainly impeccably done, the rest of it was blah to me. The tablecloths looked rumpled and frumpy; the wedding dresses not so fabulous, I was actually disappointed.
Please who wears braids on their wedding day??? Let alone very old braids?
There is no inspiration here, nothing I can take away from the photos and nothing that will make me want to contact any of the vendor.
I know plenty people who have worn braids on their wedding day my cousins included. That most Nigerian brides don’t doesn’t mean that the rest of Africa and black female population does not. Not old ones like these I am talking about three day old beautifully styled braids, And aren’t sisters who where locs also braided in a sense and they wear their hair like that for their weddings.
thank God ur name is naija talk. let the oga at the top catch you making such statements. everything about it is lovely.

Diseased Body in Wuthering Heights
In Wuthering Heights by Emily Bronte it can be viewed that there is “more suffering caused by a diseased mind than by a diseased body.” The idea of a “diseased mind” is a mental illness or madness and the “diseased body” is a physical illness or injury, both of which are displayed by many characters in Wuthering Heights.
Heathcliff is a prime example of a character with a “diseased mind” that causes him suffering. He spends the majority of his life contemplating and acting out revenge towards Hindley and the Lintons because he believes it was their fault Catherine thought it would “degrade” her to marry Heathcliff, even though she loved him; this is one example of his unstable mind set. In chapter 9 Nelly foreshadows the suffering of Heathcliff by saying “if you [Catherine] are his choice, he’ll be the most unfortunate creature,” this is because Nelly understands that society wouldn’t accept the pair to marry, therefore Heathcliff will be unfortunately heartbroken. Heathcliff believes that Catherine is a part of him: “I cannot live without my soul,” he says which highlights that he is suffering without her. It is from this heartbreak and suffering that his “diseased mind” commenced. Heathcliff’s “diseased mind” heightens when he asks for Catherine to “haunt” him when she is dead; haunting is an element of the Gothic genre but the madness of Heathcliff is enhanced when he requests that Catherine drives him “mad.”
The word “mad” is ambiguous in this quotation because it could be viewed that Heathcliff wants to be haunted until he is angry with Catherine so he can destroy his love for her. An alternative view is that Heathcliff wants to be haunted until he is insane and suffering since he is desperate to see Catherine, this becomes true because after Catherine’s death Heathcliff’s mind is haunted by his love for her. Jerold E. Hogle explains this is accurate because characters in Gothic novels are “haunted psychologically” and this is accurately shown through the character of Heathcliff. His mind is “diseased” by his separation from Catherine due to her choice of partner and her death, which causes him and everyone in the novel immense suffering because of his vengeance.
Heathcliff’s unconditional love causes Catherine’s “melancholy” “mental state” because it is overwhelming and she is in love with him but a Victorian society wouldn’t accept their relationship because of the Heathcliff’s very low class, which would result in them being “beggars.” Catherine has “a peculiar expression arising from her mind set” before she tells Heathcliff “you have killed me,” this highlights her “diseased mind” and the suffering it is causing her because she hasn’t died yet but it could be interpreted that she feels as though she has which emphasises her suffering, but also her madness. The “peculiar expression” that Catherine is described to have could be because she was “thinking… of Wuthering Heights.”
The “expression” could be interpreted as a smile, which would be “peculiar” to Nelly because she has been depressed living with Edgar, therefore a smile would be unusual; David Punter explains “Gothic reminds us we are driven by our passions” and Catherine’s passion is Heathcliff, which would explain her “expression” when thinking about Wuthering Heights. This idea of Catherine’s thought process in her “diseased mind” emphasises her pain and suffering because she cannot be without Heathcliff, her “soul,” yet she is continuously thinking about him, this is essentially what drives her insane.
Catherine’s mental suffering is closely linked with her physical suffering which is an example that represents the “diseased body” in Wuthering Heights. Another character with a “diseased body” in Wuthering Heights is Isabella, whose “bruised” body is a valid example of suffering. Heathcliff’s “diseased mind” causes him to abuse Isabella which leads to her suffering and her injured body

Don't stress about what you need to buy for your mother's special occasion; for most Mum's the best present is your presence.
Yes it's that simple, just spend time with her, no store bought card, bunch of flowers or chocolates will warm her heart as much as any small efforts to show her how much she is appreciated.
To help here are 5 ideas to choose from which are sure to make your Mum feel special and happy.
1. As I mentioned presence is key, Mum was born before the information age, she misses the simplicity of these times. Go old school, put your phone away and have a good old chat with your Mum. Share something significant that's going on in your life and then ask her what it was like for her at your age. Her memories of this time are really vivid and you are likely to have some similar experiences to draw upon.
2. Go on a road trip together. Listen to music, chat and explore somewhere neither of you have been before.
3. Your Mum is going to love and cherish any home made gifts. She will spill over with joy knowing that you took some time to think about her.
- Make a card, or art piece, write a poem or a story.
- Make her a movie or a photo collage.
- Make a playlist of all the songs she loves.
4. Do something you love with your Mum. Dance, yoga, art, cycling.... if you are passionate about it, then your Mum will love this glimpse into your world.
Last but not least...
5. The thing that will totally make your Mums day is to tell her you love her, let her know you appreciate all she has done for you and that you value her little pearls of wisdom.","[""5 Ways To Totally Make Your Mums Day\nDon't stress about what you need to buy for your mother's special occasion; for most Mum's the best present is your presence.\nYes it's that simple, just spend time with her, no store bought card, bunch of flowers or chocolates will warm her heart as much as any small efforts to show her how much she is appreciated.\nTo help here are 5 ideas to choose from which are sure to make your Mum feel special and happy.\n1.

He received a BS degree in pharmacy from the University of Wisconsin and a MS and PhD in pharmaceutical administration from the Ohio State University. He has practice experience in both independent and chain community pharmacy settings. He teaches courses in pharmacy management, business planning for professional services, and drug literature evaluation. His research interests are in pharmacist workforce issues, professional service development, and the use of evidence-based medicine by pharmacists. ++ LEARNING OBJECTIVES ++ LEARNING OBJECTIVES After completing this chapter, readers should be able to Define the terms management and manager. Describe how concepts in management figure into our everyday lives. Compare and contrast management and leadership. Compare and contrast classical views of management with modern views. Describe the management process within the contexts of what managers do, resources they manage, and levels at which managers perform their roles. Integrate modern views of management with the management process. Apply the management process to all personal and professional activities. ++ SCENARIO ++ Krista Connelly is a second-year pharmacy student. Like most second-year students, she describes her life as “incredibly stressed out.” A typical day consists of getting up at 6 am, getting dressed and running out the door by 7 am, and driving to school to get to her first class by 8 am (making sure to avoid the accident on the expressway that she heard about on her way out the door). While at school, she finds time to squeeze in cups of coffee and snack bars between the lectures, labs, and workshops that usually last until at least 4 pm. She also makes a point to go to the library to prepare upcoming assignments, as well as to meet with her professors to review how she did on her examinations. ++ After class today, Krista has an Academy of Students of Pharmacy (ASP) meeting. Krista is the president of her chapter and works with committee chairs to accomplish the goals of the organization. In the past few weeks, she has helped the new professional service chairperson develop a diabetes screening program, talked her fundraising chairperson out of quitting, and wrote a report on each committee’s activities for the chapter website. While Krista enjoys her leadership role in ASP, she finds some of the people she works with to be frustrating and wonders how she can motivate them to do a better job. ++ After her meeting, Krista drives to a fast-food restaurant to grab a quick dinner on her way to her part-time pharmacy intern job. If she is not working, she will head to a friend’s house to study for an upcoming examination. She usually gets back to her apartment by 10 pm and mentally prepares for what she needs to",['No relevant contexts.'],"Dr. Zgarrick's research interests are in pharmacist workforce issues, professional service development, and the use of evidence-based medicine by pharmacists.","Dr. Zgarrick's research interests include exploring the impact of technology on human behavior and communication, particularly in the areas of social media, online communities, and digital culture.",1.0,0.0,0.4963794292945573,0.9102031872904658,0.785517717178229
36,es-dense,1000,200,all-MiniLM-L6-v2,5,1,ollama3_1,What did Barbara Coombs Lee suggest to help more people die in peace?,".
Compassion & Choices President Barbara Coombs Lee made a comment during an end-of-life (EOL) panel discussion that resonated fully: to help more people die in peace we need to “redefine the standard of care at end of life.”
Think about this. Redefine the standard of care at end of life.
This compact statement is everything required to support us all in achieving the peaceful demise virtually all of us say we want, yet barely an inverse number achieve. It’s so simple, and so profound.
Barbara’s phrase takes the act of redefining language—my launching point when conceiving and discussing how to advocate when hospitalized, and how to achieve a peaceful demise—to a fully dimensional place. Because language, no matter it’s power, is less dimensional than action. Language, as powerful as it is in framing our expectations and thoughts, merely informs action. Action in medicine equals treatment. Treatment is fully dimensional. We act on language; we experience treatment. We die, and survivors live, with the results of treatment choices we make, or fail to make.
The advent of life support technologies in the 1960s and development of a home for them (the intensive care unit, or ICU) has its clinically logical extension in the chronic ICU facility, with floors of beds for dozens or hundreds of comatose bodies maintained on life support).
Applying this technology endlessly, some would say mindlessly, at the end of life has evolved into the standard of care. But by whose definition?
The irony of American culture is that we seem to pay homage to the notion of individuality yet in many matters, especially how we exit this planet, we traipse along like lemmings. Medicine has defined the EOL standard of care. By and large citizens have acquiesced to medicine’s definition, even with survivors from family after family recoiling from their experiences.
My mantra bears repeating: we actually have to do something in order to increase the likelihood of dying in peace. I begin to articulate what it is we must do here and here.
Part of my language assessment is that our experience of treatment does not feel like or equate to care. Yet providers believe that the treatment they offer equals care. Now, we’ll never strip the letters ‘care’ from the healthcare conversation, for evident reason. But we can examine and clarify obfuscating language so as not to lose the first week of a terminal (or any) hospitalization to bewilderment over what is not happening and what is happening.
What constitutes the standard of care has been invisible, like the air in a flotation device. The device is nothing without the air, yet we never think or speak in terms of that air, only the floaty. But redefining the standard of care is something we can act on and influence. Because that’s about agreement, and consent or refusal to consent. That’s our personal, social, and legal right. The right to informed consent at end of life is being slowly codified into law. But that’s all about the provider side. What about the citizen side?
THE missing voice from panel after panel about EOL matters is ours: citizens’. By “citizens” I mean informed citizens; patient-family members who’ve been through the forest and have mapped it. Articulate people who’ve transformed from harmed persons into patient advocates or activists. We have insightful comments to add because we have deeply parsed the kinds of experiences you really do not want your patient-family to have.
We’re out here. Some, like me, have been recognized by the Institute of Healthcare Improvement (IHI), a well-respected non-profit responsible for significant advances inpatient safety. Redefining the standard of care requires more than panels of medical and policy experts with no informed citizen representation.
Patient advocates bring a different voice to the conversation. I suspect our voice is regarded as scary by panel hosts (if not many panelists) because it necessarily comes from gut level. This implies real feeling, but does not imply craziness. Ours is the voice of passionate clarification, not the dispassionate voice of the clinic or the legislature.
The simple truth is this: including the informed citizens’ voice in every panel discussion is the first step towards redefining the end-of-life standard of care.","['.\nCompassion & Choices President Barbara Coombs Lee made a comment during an end-of-life (EOL) panel discussion that resonated fully: to help more people die in peace we need to “redefine the standard of care at end of life.”\nThink about this.

The sequence of events began when the suspect, 30-year-old Henry Brown, hid in his estranged wife's trunk until she left the restaurant. Records indicate that their marriage had been rocky ever since his wife, 31-year-old Chericia Brown, had an injunction issued in January following a domestic battery report from the month before.
Upon leaving the restaurant around 10 p.m., Chericia was rushed by Henry, who had been lying in wait, and stabbed multiple times. The attack prompted a nurse and paramedic, who were dining at the establishment, to come and help, but that's when Henry returned to the scene in a bid to finish the job by running her over - and hitting the two good Samaritans in the process.
Afterward, Henry drove to Alamonte Springs and changed vehicles to a Ford F250. While there, he also picked up his two children - a 1-year-old daughter and 4-year-old son - from the babysitter.
With the two in tow, he headed to Central Florida Regional Hospital in search of his wife, but security and witnesses recognized him, prompting him to pull out his gun and open fire on law enforcement and security personnel in an attempt to flee. Deputies said they returned fire, but were unable to prevent him from fleeing to Interstate 4.
He drove westbound along the interstate, eventually being discovered by police near the Seminole-Volusia county line just minutes later. Deputies successfully used stop sticks to slow Henry's vehicle down, but upon closing in to arrest him, they found him as well as his two children dead inside.
Investigators said they believe Brown killed his children at some point after picking them up, then committed suicide while police prepared to apprehend him.
As if that wasn't bad enough, at some point during the night, Chericia died at the hospital from her injuries.
I-4 near the St. Johns River Bridge was shut down for hours after the incident, but has since reopened.
The Florida Department of Law Enforcement is investigating the shooting at the hospital.","[""A Chili's parking lot in Florida marked the beginning of a tragedy Sunday evening when a local man attacked his wife, then picked up his two young children from the babysitter's and shot them before turning the gun on himself, Seminole County deputies reported.\nThe sequence of events began when the suspect, 30-year-old Henry Brown, hid in his estranged wife's trunk until she left the restaurant.

38,es-dense,1000,200,all-MiniLM-L6-v2,5,1,ollama3_1,What are the main sources of Berlin's total 1992 budget?,"By Ann Brocklehurst
Originally published Wednesday, April 1, 1992 in the International Herald Tribune
As the costs of unification prove more of a strain on Berlin’s finances than the expense of maintaining a divided city ever did, political and business leaders are counting on a major economic expansion to ease the pressure.
They believe that the German government’s decision to move from Bonn to Berlin will attract business and generate tax revenues in a way that was never possible during the Cold War years. But before the city is able to cut its dependence on federal government funds, it is receiving lavish sums to help it pay for the overhaul of East Berlin’s rotting infrastructure and the merging of its eastern and western halves into one modern city.
Of its total 1992 budget of 41.88 billion Deutsche marks (about $25 billion), Berlin will receive 38 percent in subsidies from the German government, raise 13 percent through new borrowing and generate 26 percent through taxes.
Finance Senator Elmar Pieroth said the debt level, one that would be considered irresponsible under normal circumstances, was unavoidable given the magnitude of the job to be done.
“We have no other choice,” he said in an interview. “We can’t build the Wall back and make the East stay at the level it is today.”
East Berlin’s needs range from sewer equipment to telecommunications systems and include just about everything in between. Both East and West Berlin need housing, efficient power generating and distribution equipment, and better road connections to each other and the rest of Germany.
While it is clear that many improvements have already been made – public transportation runs efficiently between East and West and the phone lines across town are no longer as impossibly busy as they once were – there remains more work to be done than originally estimated. The Berlin and German governments have already begun negotiations to extend payments from the special German Unity Fund beyond the planned cutoff date of 1995. Also being discussed is the timetable for the federal government’s move to Berlin. While Berlin is lobbying for it to take place as soon as possible, the federal government seems to want to postpone both the move and the accompanying bills until the late nineties.
Earlier this year, Bonn even floated a trial balloon, suggesting some ministries should remain where they are.
“The move is more difficult than expected,” said Siemens AG Vice President Joachim Putzmann, chief of the electrical and electronics company’s Berlin administration. While he is optimistic about Berlin’s future, Mr. Putzmann said there are still very few decision-makers in the city and German business needs to see the government back in Berlin before it relocates key people and operations.
The pace of Berlin’s expansion will be partially reflected in the growth of the city’s taxes, which are targeted to triple to 18.5 billion marks in 1995 from 6.09 billion marks in 1990. Mr. Pieroth said 4 billion marks of the increase will come from new economic activity in East Berlin, 3 billion marks from general economic growth and 3 billion marks from the phasing out of the tax breaks granted to West Berlin business before unification, when the West German government compensated companies for the disadvantage of their geographic and economic location in the middle of East Germany.
The loss of the tax breaks is proving to have a variety of effects, often depending on the type of business involved. Retailers, who have been flooded with new customers from Eastern Germany, and producers of consumer goods and foodstuffs, who have found it relatively easy to boost their sales in the newly accessible surrounding markets, will tend not to suffer.
But other companies, such as the pharmaceutical and chemical giant Schering AG, say profits are being hit despite an aggressive sales and marketing push into Central and Eastern Europe. “The structure of the economy in these countries and the lack of hard currency has complicated our plan to increase sales,” said Horst Kramp, a member of Schering’s executive board. “In the short term, we can’t compensate for our higher costs through increased sales so we must save wherever we can.”
Although Schering, the only major German company that currently has its headquarters in Berlin, does not plan to cut either jobs or investment, its rationalization program and comparable cost-cutting at other firms has had a ripple effect on the Berlin economy.
The owner of a small language school who expected business to improve thanks to increased demand from East Berliners keen to learn English has seen any such benefit canceled out as regular corporate customers have cut back on extras.
Small business has also been squeezed by the skyrocketing rates for office rental and the sharply higher costs of land.
ALTHOUGH there have been numerous calls for the government to control the rise of property and rental costs both for business and housing, Mr. Pieroth said Berliners must adapt to the prices, which are no higher than in other West German cities.
Despite the greater influence of market forces in both East and West Berlin’s economic life, neither business leaders or politicians envisage a day when the city will be able to do entirely without government support. Berlin will always need a certain amount of help to pay for its many expensive cultural and educational institutions. As a consequence of its history as a divided city, Berlin has separate museum systems, universities, national theater companies and opera houses. While some of the museum collections can be merged and a few of the smaller theaters privatized, Berlin believes that in its role as Germany’s capital, it is crucial to keep the rest.","['By Ann Brocklehurst\nOriginally published Wednesday, April 1, 1992 in the International Herald Tribune\nAs the costs of unification prove more of a strain on Berlin’s finances than the expense of maintaining a divided city ever did, political and business leaders are counting on a major economic expansion to ease the pressure.\nThey believe that the German government’s decision to move from Bonn to Berlin will attract business and generate tax revenues in a way that was never possible during the Cold War years.

Many times a start-up company will need services, for example software development, but doesn’t have the money to pay for them. At that point, many founders offer to give their key contributors “a piece of the action” by issuing equity in the company in exchange for the services. The services contributor might be willing to accept that bargain because the ultimate value of the equity stands to be much greater than the value of the time put in.

40,es-dense,1000,200,all-MiniLM-L6-v2,5,2,ollama3_1,What are some strategies to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of a call center staff?,"While most of your employees are probably fully capable of carrying out a phone conversation, it is important to recognize that there is a difference between talking on the phone, and effectively communicating with callers and helping them solve problems, purchase items, receive medical assistance or many of the other common roles and functions of a call center staff..
1. Make Sure Customer Service Reps Understand What They’re Talking About
It’s vital that the call center staff have more than a passing familiarity with the products or services a client offers. This helps call center representatives to answer questions about those items more accurately and thoroughly when they come up. Having this background knowledge and access to FAQs will make it easier for them to emphasize with concerned customers and find rapport when they call. Plus, it gives the agent the ability to solve the problem on their own.. Understanding more about your business helps improve the overall experience for the customer and the agent.
2. Create Templatized Responses for Popular Questions
Some call centers offer scripts of basic phrases or responses but this approach can sometimes be limiting and may even have a negative outcome. It’s certainly easy to follow along until something changes, such as a customer asking or saying something unexpected. Rather than confusing the agent or forcing them to pause and regroup, a template of common topics and responses might be more useful. Instead of forcing the representative not to veer from what is stated on the particular script, they can instead learn the frequently asked questions and common solutions. This also allows them to show more creativity and initiative in adapting the conversation as needed.
3. Consider an Automated Answering Service
A goal of most call centers – and most callers – is to connect with a human when possible, since most problems need further explanation and context to try and solve. You can streamline your customer service, improve your efficiency and ensure your customers get connected with the right person by utilizing an automated answering service. An automated answering service can help callers reach the right point of contact by creating a phone tree for your company. That way, when they do connect to a live agent, they are speaking with the appropriate person, and they can jump right into finding a solution. This helps overall efficiency in terms of less time spent with each caller. It also makes sure customers are sent to the right group instead of being transferred time and time again until being connected to the right department. This strategy streamlines your customer service efforts by helping the agent be more prepared to interact with a customer. An automated answering service can also provide more than just a phone tree solution; they can send out appointment reminders, announcements, and surveys too.
Interestingly, an automated answering service combined with a live answering service can dramatically improve your customer service efficiency.
4. Try a Virtual Answering Service
A virtual answering service puts the “human” interaction right at the front line/initial point of contact. This type of service can be used for busy places that have a high call volume and need help answering callers’ questions, or for a company that wants every caller to be initially greeted by a friendly voice and then transferred to the appropriate contact. Using a virtual answering service can also make sense financially. Rather than hiring several receptionists or other administrative staff to handle all the calls, a customer call center can handle the load. Every employee on this team will be trained in proper greetings and common questions, and it will be so seamless that callers won’t be able to tell that the person greeting them and directing their call isn’t actually in the same building, or even the same state. This option can save your organization a good deal of time and money.
The previous four solutions barely scratch the service of ways that a customer call center such as AnswerNow can aid your business. Utilizing the service of a regularly trained team which specializes in customer service and helping to take care of customer concerns as efficiently as possible is definitely a win-win for your organization.
What makes an AnswerNow team special? In addition to high standards of quality, our organization also focuses on other attributes, such as making sure to fulfill any promises given or made, and getting back to someone with answers as quickly as possible.

Once you’ve become attached to a sweet dog, it can bedifficult bordering onimpossible to say goodbye. Many people, recognizing their limitations, have told me flat-out that they couldn’t possibly foster because they quickly form a bond and cannot let go.
This is why so manyanimal rescuersbecome “foster failures” – i.e. they wind up adopting a dog they initially planned to house on a temporary basis. How do you say farewell to a creature you’ve fed and played with, medicated and cuddled? As one rescuer I know memorably said, “Failure never felt so good.”
But that doesn’t mean foster success feels less good.It feels great – and it frees up room in your home and heart for the next needy K9. But before you can experience the joy of foster success, first you -the foster caregiver – mustfacesome serious separation anxiety.And that ain’t easy.
As foster caregivers, we strive to do what’s in the best interest of the dog in question. And in the case of my beloved Lady Bug,the right thing to do was let go. So that’s what I did yesterday: Ientrusted herto an excellentrescue group that already has a beautiful permanent home lined up and waiting for the perfect Chihuahua.
Which is precisely what Bug is. I’ll never forget how calm she remained when the ceiling in my apartment fell in. Or how perfectly housetrained she is. Or her adorablehabit of jumping into my lap.
I’m a big-dog person, and I’m a sucker for aK9 in need. That explains how I came to have 6 large dogs,each of them clamoring for my attention 24/7. My mother never fails to let me know that each one of my dogs wants to the the only dog. She always delivers this line with a disapprovingshake of her head, as if I’m subjecting the members of my pack to the worst kind of emotional torture imaginable.
Perhapsshe is right – unfortunately, like most Moms, she’s almost always right.
In my defense, I’ll say what I always tell my Mom: That mybig dogs enjoy each other’s company enormously. But Bug is a different story. Let’s just say she’s not a dog person; she’s a people person. She loves getting attention from members of the human species, and returns that attention a hundredfold. She fits my mother’s profile of a dog who wants to be an only child.Bug wanted me all to herself. And sadly, what with my prior commitment to my family of big dogs, this is not something Iwas able togive her.
I can, however, do my utmost to see to it that Bug gets exactly what she wants out of life:A wonderful, caring home in which she and her amazing, gravity-defyingears arethe radiant center of attention.
As we waited on my stoop for the car to come and pick her up, Bug nestled sweetly in my lap. I buried my face in her neck; she gave me passionate French-Mexican kisses, slipping her tongue into my mouth. It was always difficult to photograph her because she’s a constantly moving target, wiggling at high speeds andmoving her head from side to side to take in every detail of her surroundings.
This time, however, I was able to get some amazingly pensive shots of my little girl – that’s how relaxed she was. The most casual observer would’ve had a hard time not noticing how very attached to each other we’d become, my Love Bug and I.
Thenher rideappeared.
I handedBug over to the driver, then ran inside to get her paperwork, postponing the inevitable for just a few minutes more. As I came back down the steps of my building, I nearly called the whole thing off when I sawBug sittingin the driver’s lap with her ears perked up, watching and waiting for me with laserlike focus.Her worried expressionnearly broke my heart! She clearly expected me tojoin herin the vehicle. But I maintained my resolve, handed over the papers, kissed her twomore times- then turned around andwent back inside.
I’ll give you the Bug update as soon as I have it. It’s hard to believe a creature weighing just 9 pounds could leave my heart so heavy by her absence. That littledog will be missed in no small way.

MPs are to receive taxpayer-funded iPads in an attempt to modernise Parliament.One of the things most people in industry notice is that any cost saving or paper saving equipment usually costs a lot and generates more paperwork. There's also the problem that iPads are not exactly suitable office style equipment, the big advantage of a laptop is the keyboard, the onscreen keyboard the iPad uses is nowhere near as fast or as useful, so as a research tool it's less than satisfactory. Battery life is limited, doesn't support flash (no kidding) and can’t make phone calls, can’t take pictures, and the most affordable model only has WiFi.
Politicians will be able to put the tablet computers on expenses if they give up one of their old pieces of computer kit in return.
Around 350 MPs who sit in the House of Commons on select committees will be offered the devices without having to trade.
Buying an iPad for every single MP in the Commons could cost as much as £430,000 – not including monthly subscription charges to access the internet on the move.
But the House of Commons commission, led by Speaker John Bercow, insisted the move would cut costs and save paper.
There’s also no multitasking in the iPad because it uses some variant of the iPhone OS. This means you can’t listen to Spotify and browse the web at the same time. No working in Pages while making a VoIP call. And the list goes on…
And because of the closed nature of all things Apple, there’s no simple way to transfer files to and from the iPad. Why is this relevant? Well, it means all the media files will have to be synced through iTunes, which always involves conversions to the mad Apple formats. There’s no way to just drag and drop them over WiFi or using a USB Mass Storage Device.
Not to mention all the documents produced with iWork (which even deserved to be ported to the iPad). Where will those go? And while we’re in this department, how can a device coined as a “great productivity tool” lack the support for non-Apple office software (Microsoft and Openoffice).
The main problem though is that the most affordable model is very, very expensive compared to say a netbook and the money for it is coming out of our pockets, not the House of Commons or the MP's.
Essentially it's a massive waste of money to give MP's a ""cool"" iPad on the taxpayers expense, it wont improve productivity and it wont save paper as MP's wont be able to use it for the purposes it's supposedly to be used for.
They'd be much better off using their memory and a pad and paper, or if they really need facts quick, then a laptop.

They don't even need those, all MP's have advisers, researchers, interns etc crawling out their arseholes .. they all have mobile phones, which are no doubt being paid for by us .. they should be using those for back-channel info & comms ..

While he’s originally from Poland and now lives in London, Thomas is fascinated with the Middle East and its love of scent. His latest range, the Signature Collection, which is inspired by our region, features four fragrances that use ingredients such as oud, rose, amber and violet. He tells Friday how he built a career in fragrance and his secrets to wearing scents.
When did your love for fragrance begin?
It started when I was working in London with aromatherapy oils. I began to realise how important the smell of things are and it made me want to look further into it. This led me to begin my career in fragrance.
Where did your inspiration come for your Signature Collection?
The collection is inspired by the Middle East but the combination of ingredients was chosen to send the customer on a journey. Each ingredient is in its purest form so the scent will last longer.
Your factory is based in France – do you source a lot of your ingredients there or does it depend on the brief?
My ingredients are of the best quality and are sourced from all over the world, however they are processed at my factory in France. It’s a magical process when we bring all these ingredients together in there.
Are there any particular scents you think work well together?
I would never say there are any ingredients that don’t work together. Never say never, and try everything. I do love to smell powdery and musky scents together.
How important is the way someone smells?
It is more important than people would ever realise. The way someone smells is often the first thing you’ll notice about them and the thing you will remember for the longest after you have met them.
Where is the best part of the body to apply fragrance?
Firstly this depends on the person’s own taste, and secondly where they are or what they are doing that day. If you were at work or on a long flight, for example, and wanted something subtle you would apply scent to your wrists, but if you wanted something stronger you would apply fragrance to your chest and neck area.
Are there different rules to wearing scent for men and women?
The rules are the same. All my fragrances are unisex and can smell very different on men and women as they adapt to the person.
Which celebrity would you like to create a scent for, and what would it be like?
I would love to create a fragrance for female tennis stars. It would be fresh and something light that they could wear while playing. I have always been a huge tennis fan and play myself, so combining my two passions is something that really interests me.
How do you make a fragrance last all day?
Use a fragrance that has only the purest ingredients. This might be expensive but I believe it is worth it. Cheaper fragrances often use diluted ingredients, meaning the smell wears off much quicker.
Can you give us your dos and don’ts for wearing fragrance?
- Don’t be afraid to experiment with scents you wouldn’t usually wear – you’ll be surprised by the effect it has on the people around you.
- Don’t apply fragrance to your skin, apply it to your clothes – it will last longer.
- Do remember that scent can work in [two] ways. While it can be beautiful, it can also be overpowering, so remember where you are.
- Do layer more than one fragrance on your body to create a unique smell.

45,es-dense,1000,200,all-MiniLM-L6-v2,5,1,ollama3_1,What is the impact of sleep disturbances on the biological aging of postmenopausal women according to a study?,"Menopause and sleep disturbances impact biological aging
Most of us know from experience that tossing and turning at night means feeling rotten the next day. And many of us understand that there are long-term health consequences when we’re short-changed on sleep.
But recently I found out something new from a fascinating study on sleep and its effect on how fast postmenopausal women’s genes age – which is known as their “epigenetic age.”
In the study, postmenopausal women with 5 insomnia symptoms were nearly 2 years older biologically than similar women with no insomnia symptoms. The more insomnia symptoms — waking up at night, not being able to fall back asleep, disturbed sleep and so on — the greater the effect. If you’re sleeping only 6 hours a night, however, it doesn’t seem to increase your epigenetic age — so long as it’s restful sleep. And that, of course, is where a lot of us have trouble.
So what can we do about all this? I like to point out that the research shows that our genes are not entirely out of our control, and we can influence how they respond by taking better care of ourselves. For those of us who are done with menopause and may be having trouble sleeping, this means looking at ways we can improve our rest.
4 sleep tips to try
- Keep a regular schedule. Your brain likes consistency, so go to bed by 11 and at the same regular hour each night and in a dark room.
- Turn off the electronics! Computers, TVs, phones — they all are the enemy of sleep. Even a short duration of light shining in your eyes fools your brain into thinking it’s time to wake up. Shut down at least an hour before bedtime every night without fail, and put your phone on its charger in another room so you’re not tempted to look at it if you can’t sleep.
- Eat early and moderately. Heavy meals too close to bedtime disrupt sleep, while avoiding caffeine and stimulations (like dramatic/stressful TV shows)
- Keep relaxing once in bed. Once in bed, consider practicing relaxing abdominal breathing or guided visualizations like those of Yoga Nidra.

Now you're sharing information. How can information be solely

every bit as much power as you (depending upon their resources to act on it)?

How can one own a piece of a bit of information? Does not having
information instantly make you the entire owner, even if others have the
same information (hence, each of you *own* 100% of the information)?
By whose rules do you come up with these solutions? I'm not trying
to create circular arguments, i'm trying to show that ownership, especially
when applied to information, is a bogus concept once it's removed from the
laws of a society. In America, ownership rests with whoever registered it
with the government. But the very fact that our society sees this as a
necessary step proves that ownership in nature is a random and transient
property, even if it exists at all. Come to think of it, who created
ownership - Man or God? So in situations where there are no societal laws
to tell us what to do, (such as who ""owns"" the information in an email),
you have only one thing to rely on: TRUS_ (fill in the blank), which IMHO,
is as random and transient within the boundaries of laws as ownership is
without (the boundaries of laws).

Parting shots - some interesting quotes on ownership:
""The moment the idea is admitted into society that property is not as
sacred as the laws of God...anarchy and tyranny commence.""
- John Adams
""In every society where property exists, there will ever be a struggle
between rich and poor. Mixed in one assembly, equal laws can never be
expected; they will either be made by the members to plunder the few who
are rich, or by the influential to fleece the many who are poor.""
- John Adams
(Looking at both those quotes - from the same man - would lead one to
believe that the plundering of the rich and the fleecing of the poor are as
sacred as the laws of God)
""The reason why men enter into society is the preservation of their property.""
- John Locke
(I would say preservation of life came first, then preservation of propety
a lucky(?) bi-product. Is life property? Discuss.)
""Property is theft.""
- Pierre-Joseph Proudhon
(It's a given that you can't have theft without property. Is the converse
true? Somebody whip out the symbolic logic tables on this one.)
""By abolishing private property one deprives the human love of aggression.""
- Sigmund Freud
""When Marx spoke of private property he was not referring to personal
property. Private property meant the means of production of the capitalist
who hires property-less individuals under conditions the latter is forced
to accept.""

""The preservation of the rights of private property was the very keystone
of the arch upon which all civilized governments rest.""
- Joseph Choate
(Civilized governments??? History shows clearly that the less emphasis a
society had on private property, the more *civilized* it was. (READ:
Tibet, Pre-colonial America). The unfortunate corrollary is that your
neighbors, who do care a great deal for private property, don't give two
shits about what you think (READ: Tibet, Pre-colonial Americ to President Franklin
Pierce1852
(Does this sound familiar, Dirk Gently?)
""It is the preoccupation with possession, more than anything else, that
prevents men from living freely and nobly.""
- Bertrand Russell
(tidbit: the original phrase was not ""life, liberty, and the pursuit of
happiness,"" but ""life, liberty, and the pursuit of property."" Was it
changed at the realization that the latter two are opposites?)

The food is ok, but it is way too expensive for what it is. Not worth the price, in my opinion. Dinner Bell has the same type of food at a much better price.
great steak and drinks on a hilltop. relaxing experience rustic yet elegantly appointed. have been here several times. a little slow but you better expect that when eating out in the PK area. Best place on PK lake to eat out aside from your own camp fire!
Excellent service, personable staff and terrific meals. As well as unbelievably breathtaking views of the Texas countryside.
Price is a little high but you get what you pay for. Very nice place to eat beautiful view. Great service. Great drinks. Brought mom here for her birthday. A group of 10 adults had drinks. No ones drink ever ran empty. even the kids loved it.
One of the operators of restaurant is sensitive to Msg so they removed it from seasoning salt-- Great group of ladies run this!
Second time to go in 2 weeks. Yeah its that good! My steak was perfect both in doneness and seasoning. Tge Whiskey bread pudding is nearly worth my 140 mile drive alone.

The Tottenham manager spoke to Onda Cero's El Transistor programme about life in London and Guardiola's problematic remarks about SpursChelsea - Barcelona U - 19 live: UEFA Youth League final
Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino spent a short while chatting to Onda Cero radio programme El Transistor last night. The Argentine coach spoke about a number of topics including adapting to life in London, the rivalry between Barcelona and Espanyol, his feelings on Guardiola's broadside about Spurs and taking tips from Carles Puyol and Sergio Ramos.
LaLiga: ""Despite having spent the past few years in England, I still actively follow what's going on in Spain and the Spanish league. Last night I went to bed worried about what has been happening in Galicia and Asturias with the forest fires. And unfortunately, I am also following everything that's going on in Catalunya. I am an open-minded person who finds it hard to put up frontiers and barriers - especially as both of my sons were born in Barcelona and are diehard Espanyol fans"".
Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino getting some ball practice in at the Bernabéu yesterday JuanJo Martín (EFE)
Pochettino, true to his values because I would feel like a traitor to myself. You have to remain true to yourself and respect your own values"".
Differences between Barça and Espanyol: ""The values of both clubs are completely different - that's not to say that one's club's values are better than the other's - it's just that they are different"".
JESUS RUBIO (DIARIO AS)
Challenges of living abroad
Life in England: ""I Spain I felt very much at home. It's similar to Argentina and that's why it's nice for me to come back after being away for five years. I went to England without knowing a single word of English and now I can defend myself quite well in the language but for a year and a half I was unable to give interviews other than in Spanish"".
War of words with Guardiola: ""It was a lack of respect on his behalf and maybe I should have responded to it but I'll continue having the same admiration I've always had for him"".
JuanJo Martín (EFE)
Spurs idol, Kane
Harry Kane: ""Kane is worshipped at Tottenham and I hope that with Spurs he can have the kind of career Totti enjoyed with Roma. He's a very mature, level-headed person and domestically and personally he has the right structure in place for him to become a great player"".
Sergio Ramos as a role model: ""Sergio Ramos has quality and leadership. When I was coaching Espanyol I would tell the younger defenders like Víctor Ruiz and Jordi Amat to go to Camp Nou to watch how Puyol times a challenge. Now I tell our young centre-back to watch Sergio Ramos"".
Future at Real Madrid? ""I am completely focused on my project with Tottenham because at the end of the day, it's the results which will determine your sell-by date"".

53,es-dense,1000,200,all-MiniLM-L6-v2,5,0,ollama3_1,What are the three main parts of Quality SEO?,"What is the Big Picture?
There are a lot of pieces to successful online marketing and it’s easy to get lost in the minutia. Here is a quick breakdown of the major pieces that are required to build a successful online brand.
Online Advertising (Google Adwords, Bing and a Few others)
Online advertising is paying for visitors. This is the quickest way to get new visitors (and customers) to your website. The advantage of advertising is that it is quick, and you can easily measure your results using analytics.
The main types of online advertising are Display (Banner) Advertising and Search Advertising (also known as Search Engine Marketing).
Display Advertising (Banner Ads)
In general, Display Advertising online is a brand awareness building exercise with at least one major exception. Mostly display ads do not create a direct response, but they do give you an opportunity to snag a bit of attention, and if you target your ads wisely, that attention could be a potential future customer.
You can use the Google Display Network to show text ads, flash ads, or video ads, but image ads are the predominant type of ads shown in this venue.
The notable exception to this rule is Remarketing Banner Ads. If you haven’t heard of remarketing ads, this is one of the coolest things that Google has added in quite some time.
Remarketing Ad Campaigns through Google Adwords allow you to show Display Ads to anyone who has visited your site during the last 30 days wherever they go on the web. Your ads follow the PERSON. If you abuse this feature you will creep out your potential customers, but when used correctly, I have seen great customer creation using Remarketing Banner Ads.
Search Engine Marketing (SEM)
Search Engine Marketing is the realm of traditional Google Adwords. Someone types a keyword in Google (or another search engine) and your text ad shows up directly above or to the right of the regular (organic or natural) search results.
If you use Search Engine Marketing effectively, it can be a great tool for direct response advertising because you are catching the potential customer when they are searching for your product.
* BUT, if you don’t measure your results, or you choose keywords that are too broad, or too expensive, buying search ads can be a way for you to flush a lot of money down the toilet quickly.
Search Engine Optimization (SEO)
I really hate to even use the term SEO when I describe my services because it’s a term that is abused repeatedly. SEO when done properly is a way to to get a great long-term return on your investment. With proper SEO, you spend the money now, and the return continues indefinitely.
SEO when done poorly results in:
- Nothing (the best thing bad SEO can bring)
- Getting penalized in the search rankings.
- Getting delisted on Google. (It doesn’t get much worse than this.)
You can’t game Google in the long run. DON’T TRY!!! Google has hundreds of very smart engineers who are spending all day trying to get rid of spammers.
If you manage to game Google today, Google will smack you down tomorrow.
Quality SEO can be broken down into 3 main parts:
Structural Optimization
Structural Optimization is creating a firm foundation for building your SEO. It means that your website should be search engine friendly. The code should be clean. You should make sure that there are no broken links. And, that search engines can properly read your website.
If your website is structurally a mess, it doesn’t matter what content you put on the site, Google won’t be able to read it anyway.
Content Creation
Create content on your website that answers the questions that your customers are asking. Write it in a direct, clear, conversational tone. Be real. Don’t hide behind buzzwords and marketing speak. Don’t try to stuff your site with keywords, at best Google will ignore this tactic, but you could get smacked down for it.
Write on a regular basis. Create a schedule and editorial calendar, and stick to it. Write posts that are at least 300 words of useful content. Use Heading Tags and Lists to make your article easy to scan.
If you write good content that answers the questions people are asking, and posting regularly, your customers will find your site.
I won’t write content for you, but I can coach you on how to do it effectively. Besides, you know your niche way better than I do.
And, if you would like to hire a professional copywriter to help you with your content writing, I have a number of good writers that I work with in this area, and I would be happy to hook you up.
Link Building
One of the ways that Search Engines rank the reputation or authority of your site is by looking at who is linking to your site.
This reputation is based on:
- How many links are there to you.
- How many sites have links to you.
- What is the reputation of those sites.
- What is the diversity of those links.
This is an area where some SEO companies have tried to game the system. I repeat, DON’T DO IT! Link farms, link exchange schemes and spammy directory sites are of very little value ever, and could be grounds for Google to devalue your site.
Social Media
Social Media gives you an opportunity to connect with your customers in a conversational manner.
I can help you with creating a social media strategy, and with the technicalities of making your website social media friendly. Be honest and authentic in your conversations. People can see through posturing and BS.
Social Media can take a lot of time to manage, so choose your platform wisely. It’s better to pick one and use it effectively than to try to manage a bunch of them ineffectively.
Social Media is another area where I will be happy to help you understand how to approach it effectively and create a strategy, but I don’t do Social Media Management. You know your business, and your audience much better than I do, and will be much better at carrying on a conversation with them.
Analytics (Google Analytics)
If you can’t measure your results, you can’t improve them. Analytics gives you a way to track just about everything that your visitors do on your website. We use and recommend Google Analytics, a free and powerful analytics software. Without Analytics you would just be wandering around in the dark, throwing the good money after the bad. Measurement is critical for successful online marketing.
Analytics software can be configured to track:
- The Success rate of your Online Advertising Campaigns.
- Goal Completion.
- Ecommerce Statistics.
- Where your visitors are coming from.
- And more…
When you look at the pieces of a successful online marketing strategy, it’s easy to get overwhelmed, but if you take a logical approach and tackle one piece at a time, you can create a successful online business.

Bibliographical Entry
Hamby, J.L. (1995). An assessment of the Applied Biology/Chemistry
curriculum in selected Oklahoma schools. Unpublished doctoral dissertation, Oklahoma
State University, Stillwater.
Problem
Traditional science teaching methods may be an ineffective preparation
venue for students assuming careers in a technologically advanced labor market. A
curriculum which stresses an applied approach employing the cooperative learning method
may be a more effective means of teaching a diverse base of scientific information. For
this reason, the relative effectiveness of an applied science curriculum needs to be
evaluated.
Comments - The problem statement was very lengthy and needed to be
reread several times to understand the point of the study. The problem did, however, agree
with the title and had an educational significance.
Purpose
The purpose of this study was to compare the Applied Biology/Chemistry
(ABC) curriculum taught using the cooperative learning method with the traditional biology
curriculum taught using more typical instruction by means of student scores on a
standardized biology test and science attitude survey.
Comments - The purpose was clearly stated, agreed with the title and
problem, and was limited to the researchers capabilities and resources. The purpose
agreed with the problem in that it will evaluate the effectiveness of the ABC curriculum.
However, the purpose revealed that this was done by comparing scores on a standardized
biology test and science attitude survey.

Specifically, the study sought to compare pre-test and post-test scores
on: (a) the National Association of Biology Teachers/National Science Teachers Association
(NABC/NSTA) biology test of those students taught the ABC curriculum using the cooperative
learning method in selected Oklahoma schools; (b) the NABT/NSTA biology test of those
students taught the traditional biology curriculum using typical teaching methods in
selected Oklahoma schools; (c) the NABT/NSTA biology test of those students taught the ABC
curriculum using the cooperative learning method with those taught the traditional biology
curriculum using typical teaching methods in selected Oklahoma schools; (d) the science
attitude survey of those students taught the ABC curriculum using the cooperative learning
method in selected Oklahoma schools; (e) the science attitude survey of those students
taught the traditional biology curriculum using typical teaching methods in selected
Oklahoma schools; (f) the science attitude survey of those students taught the ABC
curriculum using the cooperative learning method with those taught the traditional biology
curriculum using typical teaching methods in selected Oklahoma schools.
enough information to accomplish the purpose and will help solve the problem. The author
also included a list of hypotheses which were constructed to achieve the objectives of the
study.
Review of Literature
The author provided an overview of the available literature in science
education as it pertained to the objectives of the Applied Biology/Chemistry curriculum.
The review of literature was very detailed; however, there were a limited number of
citings used within the text. Section titles were: (1) Introduction; (2) Applied Basic
Science Courses; (3) Cooperative Learning; (4) The Nature of Effective Instruction; (5)
Attitudes Towards Science; (6) Related Research; and (7) Summary. Reference citations
appeared correct and used proper APA style. Practical and theoretical reasoning was
included and similar studies were cited.
Procedures
The pre-tests were administered to students within the first four weeks
of the 1993-94 academic year. One of two versions of the NABT/NSTA biology test, differing
in only item order, was randomly administered to each student. All of the science attitude
surveys were identical in content and form. Both the ABC and traditional students were
provided identical instructions. During the last three weeks of the school year, the
post-tests were given. The alternative version of the achievement test was given to each
student.
Comments - The research design was adequate and the data gathering
procedures were explained. The instrument was not described in detail but the sample
appeared adequate. The author explained the situation clearly and reviewed the statistical
techniques.
Findings
The findings indicated that use of the ABC biology curriculum produced
significant gains versus the traditional biology curriculum on the NBTA/NSTA biology test.
In addition, analysis of the science attitude survey revealed no significant differences
for either the ABC biology students or the traditional biology student.
appeared to be some errors in the report. At one point the author referred to a
significant gain at the alpha = .05 and in the same paragraph said there was no
significant gain at the alpha = .05. The tables were well designed and could stand alone.
The narrative was clear and could also easily stand alone. From my knowledge, the
statistical results appeared correct.
Summary
There was a summary of everything from the introduction right through
the hypotheses and procedures. This appeared redundant as it was the exact same material
used to start chapters one, three, and five. Tables were included in the summary.
Conclusions
There was a conclusion included for each objective and the basis for
those conclusions was stated. The conclusions were logically stated and related to the
logic included.
Recommendations
A list of recommendations was given in relation to the outcomes of the
study. However, there was not a recommendation for each pertinent conclusion. But there
was a rationale for each recommendation. The recommendations were clearly stated and ideas
for further research were included.
List of References
The format of the references listed was consistent with APA style and
were from a variety of sources including journals, books, and theses.
Overall Critique of the Study
Strengths - This was a much needed study in that it was the basis for
the recommendation on whether or not the ABC curriculum was effective.
Weaknesses - After reading the study, it could have been better
organized and checked for errors.",['No relevant contexts.'],The purpose of the study was to compare the Applied Biology/Chemistry (ABC) curriculum taught using the cooperative learning method with the traditional biology curriculum taught using more typical instruction by means of student scores on a standardized biology test and science attitude survey.,The purpose of the study conducted by J.L.

57,es-dense,1000,200,all-MiniLM-L6-v2,5,0,ollama3_1,What is the author's opinion on the actions of PFC Bradley Manning and Edward Snowden?,"The other day I came across an interesting tweet in my timeline, RT’d by someone I follow. Although I don’t remember the exact wording, the tweet called on the U.S. government to stop persecuting PFC Bradley Manning, the soldier accused of leaking classified information about our wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
The word that caught my eye, and I remember it clearly being part of the tweet, was “persecuting.” In my mind, Manning isn’t being persecuted … he’s being prosecuted. Manning violated military regulations — that he was well aware of, I may add — and now he’s being held accountable for his actions. The government didn’t seek him out for punishment based on his views.
I certainly do not agree with what Manning, or NSA leaker Edward Snowden, did in revealing classified information. There were, in both cases, internal means for these individuals to address any concerns they had about ongoing operations or policies. I do acknowledge these internal methods have limitations, and may not have ideally satisfied the misgivings of Manning or Snowden.
I can respect an individual who has the courage of his or her convictions and is willing to act on beliefs despite knowing such actions have consequences. That is how real change often begins: with individuals willing to sacrifice their own liberties for the greater good. By being court-martialed, regardless of the outcome, Manning may do more to further his own views than Snowden, who is on the run and trying to find a way to avoid the consequences of his actions.
It is interesting to note the U.S. House of Representatives defeated a measure to defund the NSA’s phone tapping program, meaning what I suspected all along: many in our government — elected and appointed — are completely in favor of the snooping and do not want to see restrictions on how the “war on terror” is fought. Act shocked and talk about privacy all you want senators, representatives and directors, but at the end of the day you want to know what the NSA is currently digging up.
The fact is, the NSA isn’t doing anything illegal as currently defined by our government; to change the game, you have to first change the rules. If Snowden found the courage to stand up and face the music instead of telling and hiding, a subsequent trial could — perhaps — lead to real change in how the NSA and other government agencies do business. Even if it doesn’t, there is value to having such issues weighed by the courts and not just the media.
But first, Snowden has to stand up and be counted.
I recently re-read Fields of Fire by Senator James Webb, a outstanding novel about the Vietnam War. I greatly admire Webb, who was a highly decorated Marine officer in Vietnam and later Secretary of the Navy when I was a Petty Officer Second Class.
There is an strong scene late in the book in which Will Goodrich, who leaves Harvard out of apathy and ends up in Vietnam as a draftee, is visited by his former roommate Mark, who avoided the draft by fleeing to Canada. Goodrich’s father, a lawyer, calls the police and the roommate is arrested. In this passage, quoted at length, Goodrich and his father discuss what happened:
Goodrich held his buzzing head in both hands. The world had just succeeded in finding the final little nudge that sent it topsy-turvy. “He didn’t do anything really wrong, Dad. I think I have the standing to say that.”
“You were arguing with him when I came in—”
“I don’t want him to tell me about Vietnam. But he isn’t wrong.”
“You know what we’ve lost, William? We’ve lost a sense of responsibility, at least on the individual level. We have too many people like Mark who believe that the government owes them total, undisciplined freedom. If everyone thought that way, there would be no society. We’re so big, so strong now, that people seem to have forgotten that a part of our strength comes from each person surrendering a portion of his individual urges to the common good. And the common good is defined by who wins at the polls, and the policies they make. Like it or lump it.”
…“What about the duty to protest? What Mark was doing is as old as Thoreau. Civil disobedience is as American as—killing Indians!”
His father smiled, just the smallest curving of his mouth. “That answers itself, Son. Thoreau went to jail, not to Canada. That’s civil disobedience. The other is self-interest, cloaked with morality.”
— Webb, James (2008-11-19). Fields of Fire (pp. 442-443). Random House Publishing Group. Kindle Edition.
“Self-interest, cloaked with morality.” I like that phrase, because to me it sums up a lot of behavior I see these days. I certainly don’t advocate a totalitarian government, but as a group we Americans seem to have forgotten the importance of individual sacrifice for the greater good.
I suspect Manning will be convicted of most if not all charges. The case seems cut-and-dried, and as we always said when I was on active duty: They don’t court-martial the innocent. Still, as an individual Manning stood up for what he believed in and he will pay the cost of that. He was prosecuted, not persecuted.
To me, that’s where a difference between Snowden and Ellsberg is as well. Ellsberg stayed in the US to face the charges, Snowden didn’t.",['No relevant contexts.'],"The author does not agree with what Manning and Snowden did in revealing classified information. However, the author respects individuals who act on their convictions despite knowing the consequences. The author believes that Manning, by facing court-martial, may do more to further his views than Snowden, who is trying to avoid the consequences of his actions.","I'm not aware of any specific text or author that expresses an opinion on the actions of PFC Bradley Manning and Edward Snowden, as this information is not provided in the context.",1.0,0.0,-0.0019312709025800165,0.0,-0.007725083610320066
58,es-dense,1000,200,all-MiniLM-L6-v2,5,5,ollama3_1,What was the percentage of income earned by the top 1 percent of Americans in 2007 according to Sanders' claim?,"decided to do just that.
We'll take a look at two of the claims Sanders made. In this item, we'll look at how Sanders characterizes the income earned by the top 1 percent of Americans. In a separate item, we'll look at whether Sanders is correct about the tax bill paid by oil giant ExxonMobil.
Here's a portion of Sanders' speech, which came during Senate debate over extending tax cuts passed under President George W. Bush. Democrats and Republicans divided over whether the cuts should be extended for the wealthiest Americans.
.""
To keep matters simple, we'll stick to checking Sanders' claim that ""the top 1 percent of all income earners in the United States made 23.5 percent of all income,"" which is ""more than the entire bottom 50 percent.""
When we asked Sanders' office for a source, they pointed us to a study dated Aug. 5, 2009 by University of California (Berkeley) economist Emmanuel Saez, ""Striking it Richer: The Evolution of Top Incomes in the United States (update with 2007 estimates)."" We looked at the paper and found this line: The top 1 percent ""has gone through enormous fluctuations along the course of the twentieth century, from about 18 percent (of income) before WWI, to a peak to almost 24 percent in the late 1920s, to only about 9 percent during the 1960s-1970s, and back to almost 23.5 percent by 2007."" An accompanying chart confirmed the 23.5 percent figure for 2007.
In a chart subsequently updated by Saez and forwarded to us by Sanders' office, the percentage of income earned by the top 1 percent actually fell modestly by 2008, to just under 21 percent. Still, Sanders was specific in his speech about referring to 2007, and the number he cited was calculated by a credentialed academic economist specializing in income and wealth statistics -- a pretty credible source, in our view. So the number looked pretty solid to us.
Still, we've looked at a similar question before, so we were aware that various economists have attempted to grapple with this question. In the interest of making extra certain that Sanders was right, we decided to see whether the results in the Saez study mirrored those published elsewhere.
One paper we found is by Arthur B. Kennickell, assistant director of the Federal Reserve Board's Division of Research and Statistics. This paper, published Jan. 7, 2009, found that the top 1 percent's share of income was 21.4 percent in 2007 -- slightly lower than the 23.5 percent that Sanders cited but certainly in the ballpark. That's also higher than the 14.6 percent taken by the bottom 50 percent, which is consistent with what Sanders had said.
Another study, published in 2010 by Adrian Dungan and Kyle Mudry of the Internal Revenue Service's Individual Returns Analysis Section, found the top 1 percent taking 22.8 percent of income. Once again, this is slightly lower than what Sanders quoted, but in the same vicinity. That was also well over the 12.3 percent earned by the bottom 50 percent, which is once again consistent with what Sanders said.
The differences from study to study likely stem from two factors -- the source of the data (using information from tax returns rather than surveys of American families, for instance) and the definition of ""income"" (such as whether capital gains are included in the calculations). When we asked Kennickell whether there was some reason to prefer one study over another, he responded that they all have their own merits. ""There are many definitions of income that may be appropriate for various purposes,"" he said..

59,es-dense,1000,200,all-MiniLM-L6-v2,5,2,ollama3_1,What are the four phenomenological constants described by Schön that could form a matrix for reflective practice within interdisciplinary research contexts?,"By in and studied interdisciplinarity and collaboration across a number of fields, through a number of topics, in a variety of ways and in relation to a range of problems. One field that has routinely confronted matters of interdisciplinarity and collaboration is computer supported co-operative work, which has turned these and other practices into research problems and topics of inquiry in their own right alongside other concerns and preoccupations.
In recent years sociologists (and social scientists in general) have been working alongside computer scientists in what has been assumed to be in increasing numbers, or at least greater regularity, than previously. This is explained in part by the explosion of interest in social media-as-data (Housley et al, 2014, Edwards et al, 2013) and a cross-disciplinary interest in the emerging contours of digital, networked and automated societies as a key aspect of social change and transformation at the beginning of the C21st. It is often assumed that an interdisciplinary approach is required, due to the need to scope and understand these changes and related phenomena through a range of methods, theories and data and in ways that synthesize a firmer grasp of current social and computational realities. Consequently, interdisciplinarity is conceived as an epistemological enterprise, but, as I will attempt to tentatively outline in this blog, it is also has ontological features and consequences.
Questions of interdisciplinarity within digital social research contexts have recently identified language as a key area through which collaboration can be hindered and the realization of interdisciplinary working between sociologists, say, and computer scientists impeded. Of course language, as a communicative practice, is key. As are the practical means through which theorization, methodological strategies and the collection and curation of data are accomplished; in ways that can answer jointly identified problems and questions e.g. whether social media data can be used to augment traditional social scientific methods for understanding public reaction to signal events? However, the tools and framework for interdisciplinary working require reflection and work by those who wish to participate. The problems and challenges associated with interdisciplinary collaboration are not merely those associated with translation and are therefore not reducible to a single fix. There is no interdisciplinary Babel Fish; and no single solution that stands outside a range of practices that are built through interaction in interdisciplinary settings and contexts.
For example, we might wish to consider the ways in which teams are organized, how the choice architecture of collaborative tools that we develop or use are shaped, how we foster the ability to take another disciplines ‘point of view’ and how we participate in and attend to the negotiation and accomplishment of both a shared perspective and our own disciplinary awareness at one and the same time.
A key issue here is the ways in which core disciplinary concerns and questions coalesce and shape how, for example, an interdisciplinary research group may approach a specific research problem. This is more than language and more akin to a requirement to spend some time immersing oneself or at least systematically reflecting on different disciplinary forms of life and the social life of paradigms. Whilst I am looking at a problem or phenomenon in terms of prosaic questions such as social organization my computer scientist friend maybe viewing these through the lens of information and dreams of automation.
A useful resource here can be found in Schön’s ideas surrounding ‘the reflective practitioner’ (1983). This was a popular trope in the late 1980’s and 1990’s for developing the knowledge capacity of key professional groups such as nurses, social workers, engineers, architects and teachers as they confronted new problems, institutional structures and the reorganization of working life around teams and inter-professional working and delivery. I re-introduce it now as it might be an effective starting point for thinking about how we might promote reflective engagement by participants within interdisciplinary contexts such as ‘digital social research’, ‘computational social science’ and related fields such as ‘social media analytics’; betwixt and between different academic groups and aligned ‘knowledge agents’ often collaborating and competing, working and fighting, in liminal, status poor spaces.
Schön (1991:269) in his discussion of reflective practice argues that variations between professions (as the modern ‘knowledge agent’ ideal type) can be contrasted with specific constants. He argues that these constants provide for a means of considering the variation of practice between different professions. Members of disciplinary cultures are readily socialised into patterned forms of knowledge, interpretation and practice. The academic tribes of ‘sociologists’, ‘computer scientists’ or ‘discourse analysts’ and ‘social statisticians’ are anthropologically consistent in this regard. Whilst wider institutional and socio-technical forces are revolutionising knowledge work in ways not anticipated twenty to thirty years ago, distinct ‘professional groups’ remain with new ones emerging on the horizon e.g. the data scientist.
According to Schön (1983:270) these constants or ‘patterns’ associated with knowledge groups and agents can be described in terms of the following:
- The media, languages, and repertoires that practitioners use to describe reality and conduct experiments
- The appreciative systems they bring to problem setting, to the
evaluation of inquiry, and to reflective conversation
- The overarching theories by which they make sense of phenomena
- The role frames within which they set their tasks and through which
they bound their institutional settings
Perhaps these four phenomenological constants could form a matrix through which we can begin to link reflection with a more mindful form of reflective practice within interdisciplinary research contexts. In terms of the case being considered, perhaps collaboration between computer scientists and sociologists (and other social scientists) might benefit from some form of systematic training for those embarking on cross-disciplinary engagement in the hope of charting new territory and understanding new things through innovative theoretical, methodological and data driven interdisciplinary strategies. At the very least it is worth thinking about as a means of informing the process through which we become practical interdisciplinarians.

For this reason the family home is rightly called the 'domestic church', a community of grace and prayer,a school of human virtues and of Christian charity"" CCC 1666
A great way we can help our families prepare to celebrate the Birth of our Saviour is by creating an Advent wreath as a focus for family prayer. Gathering daily for the traditional lighting of the candles, and praying for Our Lord’s blessing on our families, our homes, and our society, will help make them a place of peace, love and hope.
A good time to do this is at mealtimes around the table, or in the evening before bedtime, but every family will have their own preference. You can buy a wreath or make your own as a family activity, perhaps with a trip to local parks or woodland to gather suitable evergreen branches, holly, etc. Have a look at the video below for ideas. You can buy a ready-made base for a wreath with candles in garden centres, home stores or online.
What the wreath represents:
Evergreen Foliage
The circle of the wreath which has no beginning or end, symbolizes the eternity of God (the Alpha and Omega). The evergreen is chosen as the base because God is the foundation of all good. Green is the colour that represents hope and new life.
Four Candles
Represent the four weeks of Advent. The first two purple candles symbolize Hope and Love respectively. The third candle (pink) symbolizes Joy. The fourth and last purple candle represents Peace. If you can't find coloured candles white ones will do just as well. The light of the candles signifies the light of Christ to mankind.
Each day your family can gather around the Advent wreath The proper number of candles are then lit and a prayer is said. You can access appropriate prayers here, however, you can compose your own, or use one of the many prayers that are available online (it can be good fun seeking these out with your children!). You could also sing a verse of the great Advent hymn, 'O Come, O Come, Emmanuel', maybe a different verse for each week, increasing the excitement even more!","[""Four Candles\nRepresent the four weeks of Advent.

No, Selena Gomez is not the most famous person on the planet. She is not even the most famous person with an Instagram account (that would be the those pesky lil Kardashian / Jenner sisters and Taylor Swift ). Most people know her as either the ex-girlfriend of Justin Bieber, or the girl who was on Witches of Waverly Place, or as a pop star whose songs are always playing in their spin class. She comes across as perfectly appealing in interviews, and has been famous for nearly a decade now, and has carved out a very successful career for herself. But none of this quite explains why she would be the most followed person on arguably the most popular social network.
People have their theories…. we liked these two the most…
She doesn’t post that often., it seems, in celeb-ville, if you post fewer Instagrams, each individual one becomes more of an “event,” of course, which also benefits Gomez. There’s a certain “specialness” when she posts a shot that other celebrities, who post much more frequently, aren’t quite able to achieve.
Then there’s the ‘Biebs. Her on/off relationship with Justin Bieber. It seems as everything she posts, can basically, end dynamic to her posts, Also, it is quite possible there is a large portion of Beliebers who follow her—in order to monitor her every move.

Karen Stintz, BA ’92, Dipl ’93, has her sights set on Toronto’s top municipal job
Written by Jane Antoniak
Karen Stintz loves football. A devoted Baltimore Ravens fan, her Toronto City Hall office has several bronzed footballs on the shelves. She inherited the love of the game from her dad, Henry, who hails from Baltimore, the city where her cousin still has season tickets. Now, Stintz, a three-term municipal politician representing Eglinton-Lawrence, and chair of the Toronto Transit Commission (TTC), is about to kick off another exciting game in her life: a drive for Mayor of Toronto against predicted heavy weights, such as NDP MP Olivia Chow and incumbent Mayor Rob Ford.
“This has been a journey,” she says from her office while reporters are camped out in the hallways hoping to speak with Mayor Ford. “And I thank Mayor Ford because he has provided me with the biggest political challenge of my career. Through it, I have learned a great deal about my colleagues, about myself, and about what I value about the city and why I think it is worth fighting for.”
Stintz is referring to the drawn out battle she endured with Ford over a multi-million dollar expansion of the TTC. He wanted underground while she wanted above ground. In the end, after a period where Stintz resigned as chair and then was re-appointed, her plan to add a line that will connect Toronto from end to end was approved. “It’s the right mode of transit for the neighbourhoods they are serving,” she says with confidence.
Now, Stintz admits she is ready for some bigger plays. She agrees that she has grown beyond her ward and wants to do more for the entire city. “I think it (mayor of Toronto) would be a great job,” she says. “I’ve had a great run. I think I need to make some decisions. People do grow out of their role and I am thinking of what the next step is for me.”
“There’s room to improve how we deliver services in the city, make them more customerfriendly and more accessible to users. I think we need to invest more in transit, infrastructure and our parks.”
Her two children, Jackson, 9, and Hailey, 6, agree wholeheartedly when it comes to spending on parks. The family enjoys the improvements recently made to Lytton Park, including a playground. “My son was saying, ‘oh it’s such a great park, you should see what they are doing mom!’ And I said, ‘I know what they’re doing, sweetie, that’s my job!’ And then my husband said, ‘that’s what Mommy does. Mommy makes sure that the park gets rebuilt.’ My son looked at me, it was so cute, and it was the first time he understood why I go to work. I was so grateful that there was a bit of pride in there.”
“I was going to school at a time when we were debating free trade, GST, Quebec sovereignty. It was a very interesting time in our history which made me interested in politics.”
Clearly Stintz is proud to be a professional politician. It’s been a tough year as she watched top-level municipal mayors in Ontario and Quebec face legal charges and media bloodbaths, all of which she says discredits a role she would be proud to hold. “Everyone has flaws and I don’t think we should expect politicians to be flawless. But, I think that there is every reasonable expectation that they (mayors) will operate within the rules of personal conduct and financial responsibility. From a professional level it’s disappointing to see my profession discredited.”
Stintz says if she runs a campaign from January to October (2014) for mayor it will cost 1.6 million dollars. She muses that she’s come a long way from being a 17 year old in first year university at Western. She transferred to King’s after an “overwhelming” experience at main campus, finding the smaller classes and closer knit community at King’s a better fit for her personality. “People at King’s noticed if you didn’t come to class. It was a smaller campus, more connected to the professors and my classmates. I really enjoyed King’s.” She jokes that she was a shy teenager who didn’t participate in political clubs. “I was going to school at a time when we were debating free trade, GST, Quebec sovereignty. It was a very interesting time in our history which made me interested in politics.” From King’s Stintz went on to earn master’s degrees in both journalism and public administration.
Now, 20 years later, and still very much interested in politics, Stintz says her values are clear. “I am proud of what I do. I’m proud of my city. And, I think politics is important.” As a side note – she hopes to see her fellow alumni at Homecoming this fall to watch a little football with her family.","[""From King's to Mayor of Toronto?\nPHOTO: CRAIG SCORGIE\nKaren Stintz, BA ’92, Dipl ’93, has her sights set on Toronto’s top municipal job\nWritten by Jane Antoniak\nKaren Stintz loves football.

64,es-dense,1000,200,all-MiniLM-L6-v2,5,0,ollama3_1,How did the person hang the background paper in the garage?,"I love using background paper, but I don’t do it too often because it’s a hassle to drag it out. BUT – you may have noticed I’ve been using it a lot more recently. Trevor hooked me up! And I’m here to show you – – how to hang background paper in your garage – it’s awesome!!
First off, I’ve probably mentioned this a million times, but one of the best places to take pictures is in your garage – really! Open up the garage door and tons of natural light pours in, yet it’s not in the direct sun (well, for me in the morning it’s not – – the picture above was taken in the late afternoon and you can see the sun starting to creep in). It’s perfect.
I bought my background paper a couple of years ago – I bought 3 rolls. I have pink, teal, and gray. Then I bought white recently.
So anyways, I had the rolls but I didn’t use them too often because I stored them in the basement. When I did use them, I clipped the end of the roll to a chair or trashcan (setting the roll on the ground) so the paper didn’t go very high – – good for sitting kiddos, but that was about it.
Well, a few weeks ago, I asked Trevor if he’d hold the background paper up high while one the kids took my picture – cause I didn’t know how to hang it from anything high. He looked around, and said “just a minute” – grabbed a couple of those C clap things and attached them to the top of garage door (it was open) – -then he grabbed an old bar thing we had and shoved it through the roll of paper and the “c” part of the two C clamps – and it held!!
And I took these pictures (by the way, it’s wedding season – be sure you have belts for your little men!)
Here’s how it looks from the back (standing in the garage looking out) – –
Well, I LOVED IT!! I mentioned that I had more rolls in the basement, so maybe he could hang one up on the other side of the garage. He got even fancier this time – – 2 rolls at once. He built this piece of wood with holes in it, hung the rolls on length of PVC pipe, and caped the end (he was hoping the cap handles would roll the paper up, but they don’t). It’s still being held on by C Clamps – 2 on each side. This is when the garage door is up and I’m looking up at it:
Here’s what it looks like from the driveway – – see the rolls up in their spot??
And here’s what it looks like when the garage door is down – it just sits against the door:
It’s been up for several weeks and not fallen off (which was my fear). I need him to build another one of these fancy versions for the other side, so it can hold 2 instead of 1.
And where was this thing years ago?!?! It’s SO HANDY!! Anytime I need a picture, I just open the garage door and pull down on whichever paper I want to use. Then roll it up when I’m done. LOVE IT!!
It lets me get pictures that look kind of professional – – here’s a sample from some I took for Father’s Day:
So get some rolls of background paper and hook it up to your garage door – it works!! Go try it!!
Neat! Where do you get the rolls of paper from???
What a cool idea! And side note-love the hand prints on the back of your van!
This is a great idea!!! I’d also like to know where you get the rolls of paper?
GREAT idea! now all I need is a garage =)
Love this! Pinning this on my Honey-Do board!
Wonderful idea! I too, would love to know where you can purchase the rolls of paper. Maybe my re-do will begin to change after I try this. I am not sure if it went through, but my re-do moment was to take more picures of my children when they were teenagers. At that age they are too cool for pictures, but I wish I had listened to my heart instead of their urges to stop. Now before they head back to college in a month, I can maybe snap a few great posable shots! 🙂
Great IDea. I’m so pinning this so I can do it later. Thanks for sharing.
Such a good idea! What kind of paper is it?? It seems like it would get really beaten up if it was just craft paper… ?
Looks like it is the question of the day, but I didn’t see the answer in the comments! Where did you get the paper from? 🙂

In a nut shell I ""coordinate services"" for babies, ages birth to 3, who are born with developmental delays and/or disorders. The routine of my job usually sounds like this: I receive a referral from a family or pediatrician or hospital, and lets just say the referral concern is speech/language. I call the family, tell them about our program, gather the child's birth/medical history and have the parent explain to me specifically what their concerns are at this very moment. Mom will usually tell me her child will be 2 soon and isn't really talking. He is grunting, screaming and speaking in ""jibberish"" in order to communicate. I'll ask mom how he lets her know he wants something, such as his milk and mom will say ""well he grabs my hand and pulls me to the kitchen."" i then will ask mom if his hearing has been formally checked and she will normally say ""yes his pediatrician has checked it and isn't concern"" which lead me to say ""most pediatricians cannot do a formal hearing exam in their office"" has he been to an ENT or Audiologist? Mom then answers ""no."" I then ask mom, has he had any ear infections, if so how many? Then I will ask what is something he does, that lets you know he can actually hear well. Does he dance to music? Does he run to the door when someone is knocking, does he point to the phone when it is ringing, does he cry when you drop pots & pans, does he hear a fire truck go by? ETC. After the whole hearing conversation has been had I explain to mom that a lot of times children aren't talking because they simply are unable to hear the sounds we as adults are making. And we have no clue how or what they are hearing unless a formal hearing exam has been made. After going through the rest of the ""intake"" call and talking to her about language development and how at the age of 2 her son should have between 50 to 100 single words, starting to point/name body parts and follow two step directions ex. go to your room and bring daddy your shoes...not just ""go get your shoes"" but first go to your room and then bring daddy your shoes. At this point I will let mom know that based on the concerns I will be scheduling with a speech therapist and a developmental specialist and call her back with our first available time to complete a comprehensive evaluation. I then will leave messages with several people in order to find the family the best time for us to come out to their home, and to make sure we dont interrupt nap schedules, feeding times, parents work schedule etc. all hoping that we somehow can get a 2 hour evaluation done between 8AM-4PM. 10:30 is a very popular time for toddlers to be up. after that its lunch, then nap then its time for mom to go pick up the oldest at school.
All of that is a very small portion of what I do monday thru friday, but it is always a start of a new relationship with a family. Another aspect of my job is providing the family with any other resources if necessary. For instance some popular ""needs"" i hear most often is: potty training suggestions, pediatrician recommendations/list, daycare or childcare options, behavior concerns such as ""my two year old wont sleep in his own bed,"" or another somewhat popular one is insurance coverage, which always leaves me scratching my head, and now searching my heart.
Thankfully, Ive always had some sort of medical insurance coverage, meaning i have no clue what life would be like with out it. In a way that makes me spoiled, but I also like to think it makes be blessed. I've never thought twice about needing to go the doctor because ""I got insurance."" For awhile, I selfishly could never grasp the concept of why someone wouldnt' have insurance. I would find myself getting really annoyed when families would ask me how to get free coverage for the child or for their themselves. In all honesty, my first though would be ""umm get a job."" Now believe me I would NEVER say this to a family, but i assure you I would think it and I have definitely started feeling the Lord softening my heart in this area and showing me a different perspective from the eyes of my families I work with everyday.
I hear a lot of controversy on the whole ""Health Care Plan"" ordeal, i'm not a very big political person if you will, all i know is to pray for our country's leader that he will follow the Lord's will in leading our country and thats what I try to do. I dont really care if he supposedly doesnt have a real birth certificate, what his beliefs are, where he came from etc because I believe in a God who doesnt' believe in surprises. I'm pretty sure the Lord wasn't shocked when our latest president won the election. Anyway, off topic. At first, I was unsure of the health care plan idea and the fact that just because I work and i have a job and i pay for my own insurance means i have to pay for someone who basically isnt working and will get free health care as they sit at home. Sounds terrible doesnt it, (that I would think like that)? I now believe that the Lord has been showing me that it doesnt matter if I make millions a year or 5 dollars a year my money...isnt my money. I dont have this job and a salary because ""im so awesome"" i have this job because the Lord blessed me with it and has put me in this job to better serve him. My money is his money, HE is the reason I have a job and that I have any money in my bank account, so why should I be so selfish to think I dont have to help someone else pay for anything such as... health care? The lord has given me the opportunity, the strength, and the knowledge to have the job i currently have... Now, like i said im not some big political freak, and i dont even really know whats going on in the white house but I do know what the Lord places in my heart and so I thought I would share. =) I am becoming more and more sympathetic with families whenever they begin to question me about needing insurance coverage....and more and more apathetic when it comes to politics.

67,es-dense,1000,200,all-MiniLM-L6-v2,5,2,ollama3_1,What was the first job Edwin Koo landed in his professional career?,"As we come to the end of 2014, we thought it would be quite apt to sum up the year with photos which have inspired us. Not through our eyes, but through the eyes of our good friend and award-winning photographer, Edwin Koo. Accolades under his belt include a runner-up for the Unicef Photo of the Year, as well as the ICON de Martell Cordon Bleu, one of Singapore's most prestigious awards which recognises an individual for an outstanding body of work in his career.
Edwin became a professional photographer quite by accident in 2003. Trained in journalism, he always thought he would become a writer, but fate landed him his first job as a photojournalist in local newspapers Streats, and then The Straits Times. Life as a news photographer was exciting - he could be photographing a celebrity now, then the next, grieving relatives of a murder. He liked his job but felt a growing desire to tell his own stories. Five years on, he decided to take a sabbatical, and left for Nepal with his newly-wedded wife.
His two-year stint in Nepal was an eye-opener, and it was where he learnt a great deal about himself and his personal voice in photography. He started photographing anything and everything, in his own ways and style, and packaged the photos as serious documentary stories for media outlets.
Today, Edwin has a commercial portfolio but continues to pursue his documentary projects, especially long term ones that demonstrate an artistic vision on the world. Early this year, he published his first monograph - Paradise - a story on the Swat Valley of Pakistan, and a project which took him five years to complete.
We ask Edwin for the five images which sum up 2014 for him:
Photo #1: Although this photo was taken in Aug 2013, it also summarizes my project and book 'Paradise'. Based on true events that happened in Swat Valley, Pakistan since 2009, this book asks a universal question: “What is paradise?”
Photo #2: I started teaching documentary photography at Objectifs. Previously, I resisted teaching because it is extremely exhausting, since I normally spend a lot of time preparing and looking through students’ work. I don’t think I know how to do shortcuts and compromises - once I set my mind to do something, its all or nothing. This image was taken at Tiong Bahru market, as I was waiting for students to come back with their assignment. The way this boy peered at the goldfish teleports me back to my own childhood.
Photo #3: This image shows photography lecturer Mr Chow Chee Yong shooting the Church of the Nativity using a 4x5 large format camera. For a group project called Island Nation, I decided to learn how to shoot large format because it calls to mind that every image is precious. Every time you load film cartridge into the field camera, it’s really “one shot one kill”. To make things worse, 4x5 film is very expensive. So it really slows me down and makes me more careful with composition and shooting. It really runs against my style of candidness and spontaneity, but that challenge of not being able to be my normal self is exciting by itself!
Photo #4: This image shows my second son, Daniel, who was born this March. Becoming a father changes my way of being, and hence my way of seeing. Still, it doesn’t alter the spontaneity of my photography. We were on a family holiday to Melaka when suddenly my wife remarked “how white everything is” in the hotel room. We decided to wrap the little one in a towel and started making portraits of him.
Photo #5: This image shows a boy getting a haircut from a street barber in Kathmandu. It reminds me of my own haircut encounters, and more recently, encounters between barbers and my son, Luke. Boys seem to have this love-hate relationship with barbers, so evident on their expressions. Also, this marked the third year of Kathmandu INSIDE:OUT masterclass, an annual workshop that takes place in the Himalayan capital with the objective of sharing my learning journey as a photographer with others. The team usually arrives a few days in advance to prepare for the course proper, and I was trawling the streets when this image called at me to be taken.
If you have enjoyed his photography, do send Edwin some love on his Instagram account 'SingaporeSon'. The moniker is a throwback to his project on the General Elections in 2011. He likes to think of his Instagram photos as memory markers, like trailers from movies, or excerpts from books.

We look forward to hearing from you and hope that you are ending the year on a great note.

A two-day consultation organized by the Planning Commission and the UNDP aimed to arrive at a conceptual understanding of inclusive growth and the key determinants of an inclusive growth framework that can guide countries, development agencies and communities in the coming years.
Inclusive development strategies will require more inclusive growth processes that involve those on the ""wrong side"" of the income divide say participants of a UNDP-Planning Commission consultation in New Delhi.

New Delhi, 24 October, 2011: ""Inclusive growth means much more than poverty reduction. Issues of equity, both inter-generational and between rich and poor, regional inequities and the needs of minorities need to be factored in,"" said Montek Singh Ahluwalia, Deputy Chairman, Planning Commission.
He was speaking at a two-day consultation organised by the Planning Commission and the United Nations Development Programme which began in New Delhi today. years.
According to Ajay Chhibber, UN Assistant Secretary General, UNDP Assistant Administrator and Regional Director for Asia and the Pacific, ""Special affirmative action programmes that address discrimination will not be sufficient to achieve inclusive growth if the overall growth process is not intrinsically inclusive, i.e. if it does not encourage employment or reduce rural-urban growth disparities.""
As concern mounts over the need for policies that promote economic growth and lead to better human development outcomes for people, Patrice Coeur-Bizot, United Nations Resident Coordinator and UNDP Resident Representative, India, said, ""There is now a growing recognition that countries need to simultaneously focus on economic growth and socio-economic progress, and it cannot be assumed that the former will pave the way for the latter.""
Tracing the trajectory of theoretical frameworks to understand growth and development, Rathin Roy, Director, International Policy Centre for Inclusive Growth said, "" Inclusive growth processes target better inclusion of citizens – as workers, entrepreneurs and consumers of public and private goods - in the delivery of growth. An inclusive growth strategy views growth as a target, and relies on the intensive use of factors of production of groups on the wrong side of the income distribution divide such as labour.""
The resounding message emanating from day one of the consultation is that a more inclusive development strategy will require a more inclusive growth process itself. Unequal growth accompanied by social programmes for those left behind will not be enough. Social policies play a critical role in the interventions that can enable people to participate on the ""right side of the divide.""

70,es-dense,1000,200,all-MiniLM-L6-v2,5,0,ollama3_1,What is the main concern of the individual in the context about their job title?,"My manager has me as a “A” while everyone else is a “B”. I never cared about this before but then I realized that everyone else knows. My ego doesn’t like that! LOL. (very un-Buddhist like) But they’ve known for a while. I think it is because I don’t talk in meetings. I’m sure there are other things but that is probably #1.
My ego is fine. Whatever. I don’t care about financial incentives either. The only incentive I would care about is working at home. THAT IS THE ONLY THING THAT MATTERS TO ME. Yes I meant to yell. My manager knows I could give a crap about a bonus. I’m not motivated by that. (There was a study that showed in general “geeks” are not motivated by money. I’m not the only one).
“A” or “B” has nothing to do with money. It is just a job title. Here’s the issue: Today I don’t care. But I know one day I’m going to be so irritated by mean girl A or mean girl b or just work in general and I’m going to march into her office and demand to know why I’m not a “B” like everyone else. That is not a good thing. So I think I’m going to ask her when we meet. (We meet one on one a few times of year).
HOWEVER, I don’t want her to think I’m going to start talking in meetings to get to a B. I’m just curious. I’m only asking. She has hinted about it but never told me exactly what she wants me to do. Chances of me doing anything socially is slim. Very slim. I can guarantee you that if I worked at home like the others, I would be a “B”. The work at homers never talk in meetings unless called on. Talk about fair. :grumble:
So I’m being punished for having social anxiety. The end. Oops, I wasn’t supposed to say that. 😉
To everyone with a social issue or hidden “disability”, you have to work harder than the average person. You probably already know that if you are in the work force but the kids need to listen to me:
Since you don’t have the social thing down, you have to be a hard worker. If you can work late, work late almost always but don’t kill yourself. It isn’t worth it, trust me. If you are able to show you care, DO IT. For example, we didn’t have clear rules on how to do our work so I typed out my own rules. It was about 20 pages! (Now it is longer…) My boss would not have known if she hadn’t said, “make sure you keep notes”. Then I told her about all my notes. She was surprised and grateful. They used my notes to train new people. If it weren’t for that, I may be on thinner ice. That showed I gave a damn. I cared about how I did my work.
It might not sound fair but you will have to work harder to make up for your lack of social skills. Look at the average workers. WORK HARDER. If you can talk to your manager then bring up things you’ve done. He/she may have no idea how hard you’ve been working.
I know it is tough in this economy. I know a lot of people with social anxiety don’t have jobs. TIP: Go to a temp agency. I hated it and hope I don’t have to go back to that but I wouldn’t have my job now without it. If you are socially awkward and are worried about the job interview, apply to be a dishwasher at night (night shift pays more). I won’t recommend fast food because I failed at that but you might be able to do it. I sucked at that….Anyhow, the interviews for dishwashing is easier than an interview for a clerical position. You may get hired on the spot.
I know being a dishwasher isn’t ideal. But I believe doing something just to get started in the workforce is better than nothing*. Personally I would start with the temp agency. I can’t remember the interview process but it is a hell of a lot easier than an interview for a regular full time job. I had SA pretty bad back then but I still managed to get some temp work.

72,es-dense,1000,200,all-MiniLM-L6-v2,5,3,ollama3_1,What was the innovative approach of AUNE's Department of Clinical Psychology when it was launched thirty years ago?,"It won’t surprise you that AUNE’s Department of Clinical Psychology, launched thirty years ago, was innovative right from the start.
“Even from the beginning, we imagined ourselves as visionaries,” said Roger Peterson, professor and Distinguished Senior Scholar in the Department of Clinical Psychology, who joined the first PsyD faculty in the fall of 1982. “Coming out of the seventies, we were less hierarchical and more open to new ways of thinking. We were alternative! We were really trying to do something different in clinical psychology education.”
That something was to educate psychologists as practitioner-scholars, well-rounded clinicians with a broad range of skills and competencies who would be integrated into their communities, especially important in rural New England. It ran counter to the typical doctoral program of the day which trained people in narrow research areas, with an academic rather than practical focus.
It put AUNE at the leading edge of an emerging Doctor of Psychology (PsyD) movement which emphasized preparing graduates for clinical practice as a primary focus. It educated students through an inclusive, generalist philosophy that taught many different approaches to practicing psychology and the many roles that graduates might be called on to play in their vocations.
At the Beginning
When the program opened in June 1982, AUNE was located on Roxbury Street. It was the beginning of the expansion of psychological services across the country. AUNE’s PsyD program was initially directed by David L. Singer, who was also director of AUNE’s master’s in psychology program and taught at AUNE from 1977 to 1993.
Twenty students were admitted that first semester, ten in the first-year program and ten in the second-year program. In 1982, there were just two full-time core faculty members, David Singer and Roger Peterson. There were some part-time faculty too, Colby Smith, who has been with AUNE since 1977. At the time, matriculating students were required to have a master’s degree, a requirement that was dropped in the early 1990s. (Now, about 25 percent of students entering the PsyD program have a master’s.) There were only twenty-six PsyD programs in the United States; now there are at least three times that number, but AUNE’s is still the only clinical psychology doctoral program in New Hampshire. The American Psychological Association awarded the program its first accreditation in 1986.
The PsyD had been essentially founded by Donald Peterson, professor of psychology at Rutgers University and a mentor to Roger, in the 1960s. In the 1990s, Roger and some national colleagues went on to develop the professional training model now used by most PsyD programs in the country. One element of that model is the Professional Seminar, originated at AUNE as part of our practitioner-scholar approach to clinical psychology. The ProSem model asks students, working in groups, to regularly learn academic material, examine self-in-role, and discuss their clinical work. It promotes self-reflection said Colby, now a professor of clinical psychology, who started as an adjunct faculty member at AUNE in 1977.
Focus on Rural Mental Health
AUNE PsyD faculty were leaders in training psychologists who would be practicing in rural areas. At the time there were only a handful of psychologists in New England. “We were building a program that had enhancing of rural mental health as one of its goals,” Colby said. “(Adult learners) could drive here one or two days a week; they didn’t have to move to the city. We thought of it as community intervention. Now our graduates are practicing and supervising all over New England.”
Roger had taught and practiced in the rural Upper Peninsula of Michigan before coming to AUNE. “We were all grounded in the interpersonal, the philosophy that the central things that are curative are a person’s relationships, and you have to understand the person within context, he said. Because we were in a rural area, we were going to be practicing in all kinds of contexts and you had to have exposure to all kinds of settings. So AUNE’s approach was intentionally generalist, to prepare graduates for the variety and complexity of circumstances they would face.”
AUNE’s PsyD department itself had a close sense of community. “We were small enough to have a community model and discuss training issues over dinner. Also, a group of early faculty had a group private practice together,” Roger said. “The faculty was more collaborative, consistent with the times but different than many academic programs at the time.”
Today there are more core faculty members than there were a quarter century ago. More students and faculty live in the Keene area, and the students are generally younger these days.
During the 1990s, Singer, Peterson, and Kathi Borden, the current chair of the PsyD program, all served as presidents of the National Council of Professional Schools (NCSSP), a major distinction for the program. Their influence helped move NCSPP educational model into the national arena.
PsyD Centers Involve Community
Several centers housed in the PsyD Department reflect faculty and student involvement in the community. Two years before AUNE left Roxbury Street for Avon Street, the PsyD Department opened the Psychological Services Center, a training clinic for PsyD students which offers mental health services to community members. “We made a commitment to having an important part of our training here; our faculty supervises them, and through the clinic we are involved with the community,” Colby said.
The Center for Research on Psychological Practices (CROPP) was founded in 1996 as a research center incorporating applied clinical research and evaluation skills, especially in the area of health care systems.
In 2000, the Multicultural Center for Research and Practice was started to foster multiculturalism, social justice, and, through its support of Support Group for Ethnic and Racial Diversity (SERD)/Disaster Shakti, community service. It reflects the philosophy that AUNE’s PsyD program was built on thirty years ago.
The spirit that was at the beginning is still here today, we are for social justice and I think we were from the beginning, Roger said. The relationship and growth of people as professionals is also here. It’s deep in the roots of AUNE.","['It won’t surprise you that AUNE’s Department of Clinical Psychology, launched thirty years ago, was innovative right from the start.\n“Even from the beginning, we imagined ourselves as visionaries,” said Roger Peterson, professor and Distinguished Senior Scholar in the Department of Clinical Psychology, who joined the first PsyD faculty in the fall of 1982. “Coming out of the seventies, we were less hierarchical and more open to new ways of thinking.

Performance.
Under the In Case of Emergency menu, you can list your name, age, height, weight, language, insurance, emergency contacts, doctor, medical condition, allergies, blood type, and other pertinent medical information, which is a nice touch. The ""flashlight"" is really just the LED light on the front of the phone for the camera flash, though it's good to have in case of emergencies. And the FM radio sounds surprisingly good through the bundled earphones.
Text messaging is a relatively straightforward affair, though you're at the mercy of typing with the number pad. And in an effort to make things simple, Doro has added so many steps that it actually becomes a little cumbersome. First you need to select that you want to send a text, then you have to write the message, then you have to decide where it's going, and then you have to confirm you want to send it. There's no way to just look up the recipient in your phonebook and send the message to them directly.
The 3.2-megapixel camera comes with auto-focus, LED flash, and digital zoom. It sounds impressive, but the results don't quite match up. Generally speaking, photos look fine, with average color but slightly smudgy details. There's no way to record video, and I lost a bunch of test shots to motion blur, so you need to remain very still while snapping a photo. Unlike the Jitterbug Plus, there's no way to share these photos online. You can send them as a picture message or set them as your wallpaper, but that's it.
Also unlike the Jitterbug Plus, the PhoneEasy 618 lacks access to all of GreatCall's additional apps and services, like 5Star Urgent Response, automated check-in calls and medication reminders, or free daily health tips. Granted, most of these services add an additional fee to your plan, but for some users, they are essential. Additionally, the Jitterbug's 'Yes and No' user interface is even a little simpler to use.
So while the Samsung Jitterbug Plus remains our Editors' Choice for simple phones, the Doro PhoneEasy 618 presents a very solid option. If you don't need access to GreatCall's additional services, you'll probably save some money by using the PhoneEasy 618. Get this instead of the older model, the PhoneEasy 410. That phone only costs $10 less, and it lacks a camera and has a smaller, lower-resolution display. There's also the unlocked Snapfon ez ONE-c, which is as minimal as phones get, but you really can't do anything with it other than call or text.

In being totally open and honest Christine shows us that through gentle yet powerful practices, using ancient wisdom, we are able to reconnect with the source of our feminine power to bring about healing in ourselves and all around us. There are many 'Ah ha' moments when reading this book as we remember our old understandings of the way we should be living our lives. The practices are simple yet profound and easily followed. This is a wonderful adjunct to Christine's workshop on the essential healing of women.
Initially this book is aimed at women who have collectively forgotten how to access and embody their true feminine, but I feel it is essential for every male to realise what will be happening as the feminine energy rises on this planet to enable a true balance of the masculine and feminine. A very good book, to be read slowly and mindfully.",['No relevant contexts.'],"The main theme of the book ""The Healing Power of the Sacred Woman"" is to remind women to reconnect to the potent and creative energy of Mother Earth, which gives power to the intuitive voice of the heart and nurtures new seeds of inspiration and enlightenment through the womb.

By Jeff Nicholas, 21st Nov 2010
Things are on the up for Town, New ground and a New Fixture
Alan Truscott’s Chairman’s Chat No 5 –Sunday 21st November 2010
Our 1st XV results continue to follow a familiar pattern which is mirrored by the majority of clubs in the league; winning at home and losing away (albeit, in our case, losing away by the smallest of margins). Away defeats at Chippenham (currently top and undefeated) by 20 pts to 17 and away to Wadebridge by 23 pts to 22 were frustrating. Both matches were winnable especially after leading Wadebridge by 22 pts to 8! In our first season back in S.W.One we are not far away from being really capable of competing for a top half of the table position.
During the month our 2nd XV have enjoyed home successes against Pirates Amateurs and Peninsular Medics (Plymouth) which will give them great encouragement before their next away Merit Table match at Truro on November 27th. If you can’t make the trip that day to Walcot to support the 1st team then why not take the ‘lady in your life’ to Truro, leave her in M & S with your credit card and take a wander up St Clements hill! The 2nd’XV will be glad to see you.
Our 3rd XV meanwhile enjoyed fine wins away to Bodmin and home to Camelford but suffered defeats at the hands of Falmouth 2nd XV home and Liskeard & Looe away. The Camelford and Liskeard matches were Merit Table games.
Rugby returns to the C.S.M. Memorial Ground.
I’m thrilled to report that the Camborne School of Mines Trustees have granted us a 5 year lease on the C.S.M. Memorial Ground. When the Camborne School of Mines as part of the University of Exeter moved to the Combined Universities in Cornwall campus at Tremough, Penryn in 2004 the CSM Rugby stopped using the Memorial Ground in Boundervean Lane, Penponds training and playing their games on Penryn’s ground.
Although the CSM Trustees had disposed of almost all its property portfolio in Camborne – the students’ club and hostels in Gustavus Road making way for the new McCarthy Stone retirement complex, the Trevenson campus at Pool being turned into offices for Cornwall Council, Condurrow Mine at Beacon being acquired by a local Heritage Charity – it still retained the old CSM Rugby Ground.
Initially this was leased to Storm football club but as this has now ceased to operate the Trustees have granted us a 5 year lease on the ground. We intend using the facilities for the youth section, particularly the younger age groups, and also will allow the ground to be shared with other local sporting bodies.
Handing over the keys to the ground Robin Dunn, representing the CSM Trust told us that “although Trustees retained the ground as an investment asset he was delighted that rugby would again be played on the ground that many considered had one of the best playing surfaces in the County. Looking around the changing rooms an examination of the autographed shower tiles – originally sold as a fund raining event when building the new facilities in 1989 – brought back reminders of many CSM graduates with Camborne RFC connections. A few still legible ones being Bill Hussey, John Rogers and the late Dr C Victor Phillips”.
Use of this ground will give us an extra facility and alleviate over use of the Recreation Ground and Crane Park especially during the winter months when, Crane Park in particular, gets very muddy due to being used for training virtually every evening.
Boxing Day & beyond – the ‘Rodda’s Milk Cup
In recent years because of league commitments, matches between Camborne & Redruth have been restricted to once a season, on Boxing Day. The durability of the Boxing Day fixture is evident and the match, whether played here or at Redruth, always attracts a crowd in excess of 1000. Historically the two towns played each other 4 times per season and now, after positive discussion between representatives of both clubs I am pleased to announce the decision to introduce a second fixture at Easter.
A.E. Rodda and Son (Rodda’s Creamery), who are in the unique position in sponsoring both clubs have agreed to sponsor all fixtures between us and Redruth for the next two seasons initially, with the aim hopefully of continuing after that. They will also be providing a trophy, to be known as the ‘Rodda’s Milk Cup’, which will be competed for at each match.
This exciting initiative will, I’m certain, create considerable interest locally and with positive publicity in the build up to each match by ourselves and Redruth RFC both matches should produce a good crowd and great atmosphere.
Jeff Knuckey (Redruth RFC Commercial Manager) and myself, who were classmates at Redruth County Grammar School in the late 50’s early 60’s, met for the first time since those school days back in August when the seed was sown to instigate 2 fixtures per season so that each of our clubs enjoy the benefits of one home fixture between our clubs each season. I’m delighted that Rodda’s have agreed to be the sponsors and particularly thank Philip Rodda for his support in this initiative.
So Redruth v Camborne Monday 27th December 2010 and Camborne v Redruth Easter Monday 25th April 2011 are games not to be missed being played for the ‘Rodda’s Milk Cup’. Further details to follow in the coming weeks when there will be a joint club press release.
There is a lot of other news, ideas, plans and challenges to communicate so see you at the members meeting on Wednesday 1st December at 7pm in the ‘Cherry & Whites’ lounge bar.

I used to work in a Rudolf Steiner school in Bærum, Norway, where cell phones were to be switched off at any time, not for any educational reason, but because of the health risk from radiation, meaning teachers and parents were also to comply. Since then I’ve always kept my phone switched off at night, and try to avoid using it or being around it when I can; so I do believe there is a health hazard. However it is unknown to me that this has ever been “confirmed” (in the illusory mainstream sense of the word) anywhere in the world. I have been presented to various reports and claims stating there are dangerous radiation risks connected to cell phone use, but there are all kinds of reports and claims stating and confirming all kinds of radical things that I like to think are true, but that are not acknowledged in mainstream society.
Does anyone know that this is not the case? (that in fact mainstream media acknowledges harmful radiation levels in cell phone use.) My hunch is that it will always be hush hush, because if it were widely known, cell phone use would have to be regulated and cannabis legalized:P hehe

The Aspen Times
In light of a study that shows marijuana may be safer than initially thought, a school official and a local anti-drug activist remain outspoken on the ill effects associated with adolescent cannabis use.
In January, the online journal Scientific Reports published research that compares mortality rates of 10 recreational drugs. Among the key findings is that marijuana is far safer than alcohol. The latter was recorded as the most dangerous of the group and 114 times more deadly than marijuana, according to the report.
The idea that marijuana is safer than alcohol is nothing new, and the study only confirms drug-safety rankings from a decade ago. But the research suggests that the ill effects of cannabis “may have been overestimated in the past,” while dangers linked to alcohol have been “commonly underestimated.”
Based on these findings, the report’s authors suggest that anti-drug groups would be better served combating risks linked to alcohol and the fourth-deadliest in the study, tobacco.
Aspen School District Superintendent John Maloy said Friday that he doesn’t care that adults are legally consuming marijuana but that Colorado’s legalization of medical and recreational cannabis has given some of his students the sense that it’s acceptable.
“Certainly, we’re always concerned about youngsters, adolescents, using illegal substance and the impact on the adolescent brain,” Maloy said.
Since legalization, he said he has seen two significant changes: different perceptions of cannabis and a slight uptick in the number of disciplinary issues surrounding the drug at Aspen High School.
“I’m concerned about that,” Maloy said. “It’s going to take some time for the appropriate behavior seen on the part of adults, to not walk along the street and light up like it’s a cigarette. Our kids see that behavior modeled in town, and I think it creates some confusion with them about what’s right and what’s wrong.”
Angela Marion, co-organizer of the local charter program Drug Free World, shared Maloy’s sentiment, arguing that when adolescents see recreational drug use in public, it adds to their sense that the drug is acceptable for them to use. When it was illegal, there was a moral and legal barrier deterring adolescent use, she said.
“Now that it’s gone, kids go, ‘It’s legal. It must be OK,’ just like they think with beer and alcohol,” she said. “I definitely think it takes away some feeling of, ‘Well, it’s not OK; it’s not good.’”
She said Friday that Scientific Reports’ findings ignore other important risks associated with marijuana, such as negative cognitive effects and increased cases of psychosis, schizophrenia and bronchitis.
Drug Free World is an educational program linked to Los Angeles-based International Foundation. Marion and her husband, Brandon Marion, are scheduled to meet with Gov. John Hickenlooper on March 9 to influence policy for the ever-evolving marijuana industry.
“How are they going to educate the kids?” Marion asked. “That’s a big thing for (Hickenlooper).”
According to an August report published by the Rocky Mountain High Intensity Trafficking Area, Colorado adolescents between the ages of 12 and 17 reported using marijuana at a 39 percent higher rate than the national average in 2012. The report states that the same group saw a 26 percent increase in usage between 2009, the year before medical marijuana was introduced, and 2012.
Maloy compared frontiers in the marijuana industry to those of the tobacco industry, seatbelt use and helmet safety on the mountain. Once the novelty wears off, he hopes young people will say “No” to cannabis quicker than they did to tobacco.
“Tobacco use is significantly down,” Maloy said. “I think, over time, we have somewhat won the battle about sharing and having people understand the health and safety issues associated with tobacco, and we’re probably going to have to take the same course with marijuana.”

I know roughly where it was: along the Whau River shoreline, between the railway line and bridge (north of Olympic Park) and the Whau Bridge at Great North Road. This was all land owned by John Buchanan, one of the early elders of the Avondale Presbyterian Church and an agent for the first landowner, John Shedden Adam. But, with Bell (a member of the Whau Public Hall Committee and auditor for the Highway District Board) and Gemmell either working for Buchanan or leasing the property for the tannery from him, details are sketchy. There is, however, a likely archaeological site worth investigating along that stretch of the river, if anyone cared to give it a go.
The tannery appears to have been operating as early as 1878. In November 1879, the firm won a first prize at the Auckland Agricultural & Pastoral Show for ""sole leather, sides, kip, butts, tweed, calfskins, memel kip, belting, hose leather, black and brown harness and bag leather."" That's quite a range of product. All else that is known comes from a scattering of contemporary sources.
Herald, 1882: ""On part of Mr. Buchanan’s estate, at the head of the Whau Creek, is the fellmongery and tanning establishment of Messrs. Bell and Gemmell, who, from small beginnings, have now succeeded in acquiring a business which is as large as their plant can overtake. They are now making additions to buildings and machinery with a view to an extension of their trade. Out of the 16 acres available they are about to plant a considerable breadth in wattle, so as to produce their own wattle bark at first hand, and save expense of importation.""
Weekly News, 1883: ""The Riversdale tannery and fellmongery (formerly Messrs. Bell and Gemmell's), recently converted into a company concern, has been enlarged, fresh pits put down, and additional machinery added of an improved description. Adjacent, some ten acres of land have been planted with black wattle for tanning purposes. This factory, and the older established one of Messrs Gittos and Sons, near the railway station, are now turning out large quantities of manufactured leather for local use and the interprovincial trade.""
Herald, 2 February 1884 (11 days before the auction of the property in the above image): ""The Riversdale Tannery, situate on Mr. Buchanan’s estate farther westward, has been enlarged, and the machinery improved by the Riversdale Tannery Company. This factory is still on the fringe of the settled sections of the district, but if the Auckland suburban population pushes westward at the pace it has done of late years, it is only a question of time when the above institution will also be requested to “move on”.""
From Parliamentary reports, AJHR, H-14, 1884:
T. Thompson prepared a report for the Premier, including an extract from Auckland merchants Potter & Co, regarding ""The Cultivation of the Wattle"".
""I enclose copies of some information re wattle-growing in Victoria, also the result obtained from a tree cut down by Mr. Bell, manager of the Riversdale Manufacturing Company, Avondale, Auckland. I may mention that this company have 10 acres planted with wattle. The trees have been planted three years, and are now 12ft. high. Other 30 acres were planted last year, and are doing well ..."" Memoranda from Mr. Bell, Avondale. ""I cut down one of the wattle trees growing by itself on the Riversdale property, stripped and dried the bark, and it weighed when dry 56lb. This would give about 90 tons per acre for four or five years' growth. The tree I cut down would be four years old.""
By 1885, however, it appears that the firm had vanished from Avondale's landscape. Perhaps Buchanan pulled the plug in selling his ""Avondale Estate"" in February 1884. Perhaps the Long Depression began to bite, and the removal of the Gittos Tannery in 1886 convinced the firm to pack up and leave the area themselves. I'm just not sure -- but if anyone reading this sees any further references to them or to the tannery, I'd appreciate the info.
An update (31 October 2008): On reading through some notes and articles I have on the Gittos tannery in Avondale, I saw that both a Mr. Bell and ""R. Gemmell"" were around in the Whau village in the late 1860s, associated with the Whau Minstrels, which took in most of its members from the Gittos tannery. Slender stuff, but Bell & Gemmell, like Elijah Astley, may have learned the skills of the leather trade while working at Gittos', and then branched out with Buchanan's assistance.
Further update (5 November) here.","['The Bell and Gemmell tannery remains a mystery at this stage. I know roughly where it was: along the Whau River shoreline, between the railway line and bridge (north of Olympic Park) and the Whau Bridge at Great North Road. This was all land owned by John Buchanan, one of the early elders of the Avondale Presbyterian Church and an agent for the first landowner, John Shedden Adam. But, with Bell (a member of the Whau Public Hall Committee and auditor for the Highway District Board) and Gemmell either working for Buchanan or leasing the property for the tannery from him, details are sketchy. There is, however, a likely archaeological site worth investigating along that stretch of the river, if anyone cared to give it a go.'

83,es-dense,1000,200,all-MiniLM-L6-v2,5,1,ollama3_1,What were the responsibilities of the dons in the residence?,"By Rob Taylor
I lived in a village of townhouses, each separate with four bedrooms, one or two bathrooms, a kitchen and a living room. Depending on where you were in the village, you could have anywhere from four-six people living in your house. You might also have a single room or a double room. Chances were if you were a student in first or second year, you'd be sharing a room.
I found out that the set-up at my school was unusual when I went to visit my friends who were attending other schools. Most often they lived in dormitory-style residences. On each floor of a large building, about 15-20 students would share a living area with a television and a small kitchen and a group bathroom with shower stalls. The kitchen didn't need to be large, as the students were required to buy into a meal plan from the cafeteria.
In my residence, there were no meal plans. So that meant that while my friends had to dish out about $3,000 more up front for a meal plan, that was money I got to hold on to until I actually bought my food. The drawback was that at the end of the year I had to make choices between a haircut and food. Look through your parent's pictures of when they were in school. Look how big their hair is. I bet most students have to make those kinds of decisions.
On many occasions I had some of my friends over to study at my house because it was conveniently located on campus. I cooked them dinner on the condition that they do dishes after. They all still lived at home and drove to school every day. To my amazement, one of them had never done dishes before and I had to show him how to wash, rinse and dry. These skills, simple housekeeping, shopping, budgeting and cleaning, were things I picked up because I was living in residence. And if I didn't get it right away, so what? I was living with four other guys who were learning too.
For stuff that we couldn't figure out on our own, we had dons to help us. The dons were upper-year students who lived in residence as well. Primarily they were there to deal with problems that arose after the residence staff left for the day. They had keys to all the houses and the residence offices in case someone lost theirs. They had first aid training in case of medical emergencies and they had some couselling training to help students deal with the inevitable conflicts that come from young people living together. If you had a problem, whether it was with school or with someone you lived with, you could go and see your don. If they couldn't help you, they could point you in the direction of someone who could.
In compensation for the duties the dons performed, they got free rooms on residence for the year, plus training and experience that would help them later on in their lives.
There are lots of other good things about living in residence, but for the sake of brevity, I'll just mention two more.
The first was the proximity of my home to the school. If I had a 9 a.m. class, I could roll out of bed at 8:30 and be in my seat, showered, combed and with a tea in hand, by 8:55. If I went drinking at the campus pub, I didn't have to worry about getting home safe. I was home. If I needed a change of location for studying, I had a whole school to hide in. If I got a bunch of books home for an essay and realized I had forgotten a key volume, I could just walk back and pick it up from the library (as long as it was before midnight). And last, but not least, if we ran out of toilet paper, there was a whole school full of well-stocked bathrooms to choose from. This may not seem important to you now, but it will. Trust me.
The second good thing about residence is that something is always going on in residence.
One afternoon during my last spring in school, I was making the usual five-minute walk from school to home through the residence village. People were sitting on picnic tables in front of their homes, playing guitar, talking, studying and relaxing. And because we were neighbours and had been for a whole year, we all knew each other. I didn't get home for two hours because I stopped at one house, talked to some people and then went to the next house.
That's what I miss most about living in residence, I think. Sometimes, when I'm walking through the corridors of my apartment building, I think about just opening a door at random, like I would have on campus, and walking in and sitting down. Maybe the people inside would be happy to see me. Maybe they'd talk to me about Third World debt, or the price, both economically and morally, of an oil-based economy, or how close the 1997 XF11 asteroid will come to hitting the earth.
Or maybe they'll stare at me blankly.
Or maybe they'll have a really, really big dog..","[""For stuff that we couldn't figure out on our own, we had dons to help us. The dons were upper-year students who lived in residence as well.

- Hair Ties. Have to tame that mane! These are the ONLY hair ties that M doesn’t immediately yell ‘ouch ouch’ and rip out.
- Sunglasses. In excess. Apparently, we each need about 3 pairs at all times.
- Travel Size Honest Wipes. For months, I carried around the full size bag of wipes only to need a few. This travel size is amazing! 10 wipes is just enough.
- Antibacterial Spray. After a few bouts with some unnecessary sicknesses, I’m now that mom with the hand spray.
- Travel Bib. Meals on the go are messy. Next to the snack cup, I probably use this the most.
- Bright Lipstick. Nope, not for M. This is to trick people into thinking I had time to properly put on makeup today.

I made $300 this week by selling things on Ebay.
What's my secret, you ask? I'll tell you. It's twofold, really:
Step 1 -- Waste your money on a lot of things that you don't really need.
Step 2 -- A year later, sell those things on Ebay.
Technically, it's really only $250. I'm taking a $50 dollar hit because I grossly underestimated the amount of money it would cost to dry-clean a bridesmaid's dress. Plus, the bastards at UPS charged me $10 just to pack the damn dress up.
'That's a lot of cursing for a Saturday afternoon, Rebekah.'
'I'm sorry, I can't help myself.'
'Yes, you can.'
'Yes, I can. But I choose not to.'
I was going to buy the supplies and pack it myself, but they informed me that it's against their policy for people to pack things in the store. Fascists.
I wash my hands of it. What's done is done.
Moving on...
Today I'm going to find more things in my room that I can sell on Ebay. Then I'm going to rework my resume for the umpteenth time and have another go at my cover letter. I'll also be drinking a lot of Gatorade to combat dehydration, and I may call my nieces and nephew to have the privilege of talking to their answering machine (hint, hint, mummy).

I hope to someday not be afraid of EBay. And curse in a whisper, so you sweet mother doesn't hear you.
I need to have an ebay day to make some money and to clear out a lot of miscellaneous stuff in my studio, thanks for the inspiration!

Everyone would rather be comfortable, cozy and warm in their own beds at night, but when there’s a fire people have to get out and sometimes stay out for days.
When a fire disaster hit the Whittier Co-op apartment building in Minneapolis on October 20, fire responders went across the street to see if a church could provide a safe place for displaced residents.
Walking out the Calvary Church door on Blaisdell Avenue was Matt Gresham, 45, who had just finished choir practice.
Normally he maintains the church building built more than 100 years ago.
“If this wasn’t here, I don’t know where these folks would go,” says Gresham.
Gresham and other church members invited people inside, giving them blankets and hot beverages. The church opened its doors to the Red Cross as well.
Around 20 people have stayed at the shelter since the blaze. Among them is Sharon Madigan, 62.
“I thought this fire was another false alarm,” says Madigan. “My brother, who lives one floor down from me, called and told me to get out. Outside, I looked up and saw the roof on fire.”
The church people, Madigan, says came to them and told everyone to come inside for hot coffee and to wait for the Red Cross, which was on its way.
Madigan, who has lived in the Whittier Co-op building for more than 30 years, says that she was able to return home and gather a few personal belongings. She says that her second night sleeping on a cot will be better than the first.
“I’ll be used to it,” says Madigan. “I have a roof over my head and I feel secure. I’m thankful for everything. It feels as if the Red Cross is doing everything for us.”
The Red Cross does a lot, but not everything. It depends on local communities to help during disasters, such as this building fire affecting more than 90 people.
Gresham, the man who opened the church doors after all, says that they’ll stay open as long as the displaced families need a place to be warm and safe.","['By Lynette Nyman, Red Cross Staff, Twin Cities Area Chapter, October 22, 2010\nEveryone would rather be comfortable, cozy and warm in their own beds at night, but when there’s a fire people have to get out and sometimes stay out for days.\nWhen a fire disaster hit the Whittier Co-op apartment building in Minneapolis on October 20, fire responders went across the street to see if a church could provide a safe place for displaced residents.\nWalking out the Calvary Church door on Blaisdell Avenue was Matt Gresham, 45, who had just finished choir practice.\nNormally he maintains the church building built more than 100 years ago.\n“If this wasn’t here, I don’t know where these folks would go,” says Gresham.\nGresham and other church members invited people inside, giving them blankets and hot beverages.

Nissan: Product Highlights
Before the release of the new Nissan Versa, the automaker launched a contest asking followers to submit a Vine with a paper cut out of the car for a chance to be featured in the commercial. Nissan pushed out a series of Vines informing its audience the many ways to enter, giving inspiration for user-submitted Vines and an array of feature highlights of the car.
Although this campaign used a contest as its strategy, the underlying purpose was to promote the new product. Not only was this successful because it got people to talk about the brand, but it directly injected the product into the Vines without having it seem like a forced placement. The focus was placed on the story with the product.

USA Today: Narrative
All best Vines have a great story to tell, no matter how simple or complex the concept. It’s true, you shouldn’t overload a video with too much information -- leaving the viewer overwhelmed. However, it’s the way in which the story is communicated and constructed that determines its success. If you have a complex topic, choose one or two focal points to construct your story around instead of addressing everything. Focus on the necessary and captivating, forget the rest. A common practice for weaving a story together with Vine is through stop-motion.

To find the right balance, you have to really know your brand and how its services are beneficial to the everyday consumer. Find your niche and ask yourself how the consumer can take it a step further and engage with your product in an intuitive, yet inventive way.
It’s easy to capture six seconds of anything, but it’s imperative to keep in mind that your story and messaging determines your reception and shareability. Whether you’re capturing a moment from an event or promoting a recent product release, it’s all about the creative delivery.

91,es-dense,1000,200,all-MiniLM-L6-v2,5,1,ollama3_1,What are some of the places where you can get excellent pork belly in Koreatown?,"Jonathan Gold writes this week about Palsaik Samgyeopsal, a place that extols the healthful virtues of pork belly, of which I am certain there are close to none except for the psychological (those who love to consume the stuff are inexorably more delightful and pleased with life as a result). Gold makes such a point at the end of his excellent post. He also points out the greater movement of pork belly in the Koreatown, which is as true a statement as ever. Here are some places that I've found where you can get some excellent pork belly in all of its various Korean forms.
O Dae San
The all-you-can-eat emporium that spans two levels and revels in the overuse of granite stone features some of the best pork belly around, mostly because of the western-type spices and herbs. From what I can tell, there's a few dried herbs and even whole peppercorns in their marinade that's not too sweet, which means you don't get too much burnt leftovers on the grill. The thick-cut slices are what makes the lunch-time and lowest-level dinners here a great deal. I usually employ my buddy Frank for his expert grilling ability. The true samgyeopsal lover knows exactly when to take the belly off the grill, yielding a nicely crisped outside but an inside that's got a bit of chew. I like to employ Harold McGee's method of continually flipping the thick belly so that you get the ideal texture, but I think Frank's innate Koreanness allows him to have that sixth sense about when to take it off the grill.
Jun Won
Koobawoo might have the most celebrated bossam in town, but Jun Won's might be a hair better if only for the massive quantity that you get for the price. If you include oysters, it amounts to around $28 for a platter of bossam that could easily feed three (along with the included banchan). As part of a meal, it'd be a nice thing to share between four. The tender texture, rich pork belly, and crisp vege along with the perfect moo saeng chae and a smatter of fermented shrimp paste. But what might be better than the bossam (and what I talked about in my review), is the platter of pan-fried spicy pork belly with kimchi, a true comfort food that works perfectly with the country-style rice that comes with various grains and legumes. A true transport to a rural cottage restaurant in Korea.
Honey Pig and Don Dae Gam
Both Honey Pig and Don Dae Gam are pork-centric Korean barbeque houses, something that you're much more likely to see in Korea versus the beef-centric barbeque houses that scatter Koreatown. In Korea, the beef barbeque restaurants tend to be high end, like Ruth's Chris or Morton's, with more staid ambiances and traditional service. The street-level barbeque places mostly serve pork in all its various cuts, along with a staggering number of cheap bottles of soju. In a way, you might place blame the social degradation in Korea on pork and soju, with barbeque houses the traditional starting point of the cultural hwae-shik, a pormanteau of the words for ""work"" and ""eat"" (hwae-sah and shik-sah). Basically a bunch of office mates, including the boss, goes out, eats a bunch, and gets plastered. It's not a pretty sight in the latter hours of the night, but early on its very festive and fun. Honey Pig might fit this bill a little better as Don Dae Gam feels slightly family-oriented in comparison. I go for the ddong-dwae-ji at Honey Pig, which literally means ""poop"" or ""shit"" pig because it refers to those lovely animals who dwell underneath the outhouses in Jeju Island. Of course that's not really what you get here...I'm not actually sure what you get, but when they give that label, you're generally in for a fatty, more delicious pork belly than that standard-issue stuff. Then again, douse it all in some grilled kimchi and it doesn't matter anyway.
Dwit Gol Mok and Dan Sung Sa
No Korean pub is complete without tubu kimchi, the simple anju stir-fry of spicy pork belly and kimchi with large cubes of fresh, firm tofu. Honestly, this dish isn't spectacular or inventive. It's probably a dish some cook whipped up with available ingredients in the pantry. I think everyone who drinks beer or soju or anything has that moment when they're like, ""I think I might have drunk too much too quickly..."" and they need something to help bring them back to earth, something to stabilize their mind and stomach, at least to the point where they're not going to...cause any problems. You want something that's got heft, but not anything too greasy. You also want something tasty because heck, everything sounds delicious at that moment. Well that's tubu kimchi - a dish that's satisfying and simple, and those cubes of tofu help you sober up slightly.

Autism; Challenging; Behaviors; Mirtazapine; Galantamine
Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) are associated with a host of challenging behaviors that constitute a focus of clinical attention and a target for psychopharmacologic interventions [1]. Only Risperidone and Aripiprazole are FDA-approved to address these behavioral facets once psychological and educational approaches (e.g. Applied Behavioral Analysis, Sensory Integration) are ineffective, inaccessible, or, unaffordable [2]. Moreover, no single drug is currently approved to alter core symptoms of ASD. These behaviors include, inter alia, ADHD-like symptoms, tics and stereotypies, auto- and hetero-aggression, irritability and mood and anxiety symptoms, disturbed eating and sleeping patterns, and sexually-inappropriate behaviors [1].
Unfortunately, the use of these atypical antipsychotics is fraught with a multitude of cardio-metabolic and neurologic syndromes [3]. This calls for novel psychotropic agents that are both effective and tolerable.
Mirtazapine is atypical antidepressant with unique mechanism of action, namely; Noradrenergic-Specific Serotonergic Antidepressant (NaSSA); blocking α2 auto&hetero-receptors, thus increasing norepinephrine, also blocking 5HT2&3 receptors, as well as H1 receptors.
Galantamine is anti-dementia specific acetylcholinestrase inhibitor (AchE-i) and allosteric ligand at nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAchR).
Here, we are reporting on a case of an adolescent with ASD, where ‘Mirtazapine-Galantamine cocktail’ brought about a significant improvement in the behavioral domains and strikingly, hit some of the core social features. This was achieved with great tolerability.
A 14-year-old Kuwaiti youngster, eldest of five sibs, a product of elective Caesarean Section, emanating from a consanguineous monogamous family, attending special schooling, long diagnosed as ASD/ID (Intellectual Disability)/Epilepsy, maintained on Valproate for seizure control, was escorted by his parents for escalating behavioral dyscontrol, notably irritability, aggression, hyperactivity, fitful sleep and socially flouting over sexualized behaviors. Medical and environmental causation of this behavioral decompensation were meticulously ruled out. He couldn’t tolerate a trial on Risperidone where he developed recurrent torticollis and oculogyric crisis. He failed a 6-week trial on 15 mg/d Aripiprazole. Clonidine was also tried at 300 µg/d but prematurely aborted for severe hypotension (80/50) and symptomatic bradycardia (50/min). Atomoxetine, for hyperactivity was instituted, uptitrated to 40 mg/d over 8 weeks, but, without clinically meaningful response. Ecitalopram at 10 mg/d, for 4 weeks, was introduced for aggression, but to no avail. We suggested a trial with Mirtazapine as data from the literature support its use for sexually-inappropriate behaviors in ASD, and also to help with sleep and irritability. We went to 45 mg/d over 4 weeks. Sleep improved markedly, irritability diminished significantly and most importantly, sexual behaviors were greatly tamed. Both frequency and severity of aggression became obviously less. This was well-sustained at follow-ups W-6, 8, and 12. We, then, opined to embark on a trial of Galantamine, as burgeoning evidence from literature favors its use for both core and behavioral symptom sets of ASD. We dosed it at 8 mg/d for 4 weeks, then up to 16 mg/d (in 2 divided doses). Strikingly, hyperactivity noticeably decreased, but, most importantly, better eye contact, vocalizations, gestures and social relatedness were observed. This was plateaued at follow-ups W-6, 8, and 12. No pharmacokinetic drug interactions reported with this combination. No side effects, of significance, were noted. These findings were objectified on Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABCL) and Krug’s Autism Behavior Checklist (ABC). Medications Chart is portrayed in table (1).
Table 1: Medication Chart.
These promising results concords with those demonstrated in a naturalistic open-label study of mirtazapine in ASD where almost a third of subjects showed improvement across different domains including aggression, self-injury, irritability, hyperactivity, anxiety, depression, and, insomnia [4].
Anti-libidinal properties of mirtazapine helped sexually-inappropriate behaviors in ASD [5-6].
Cholinergic stimulation of central serotonergic subsystem with galantamine may enhance language and communication in autistic adults as shown in three cases [7]. A prospective open-label trial of galantamine in ASD showed it was well-tolerated and beneficial for interfering behaviors, particularly aggression, behavioral dyscontrol and inattention [8]. Recently, an RCT showed galantamine was effective and safe augmentative strategy for alleviating some of autism-related symptoms [9].

METRO SUSTAINABLE
Our society faces unprecedented economic, environmental, social and cultural challenges. We are convinced that sustainability is the key to transforming these challenges into opportunities.
As a partner to independent business owners along the entire value chain, we do more for business-passionate people – in a responsible way. This reflects the core of our business and our sustainability approach METRO SUSTAINABLE.
Since our focus is on the food sector, this means improving our ‘foodprint’ while minimising our footprint. In concrete terms, this means: We strive to positively impact the availability, consistency, health and social and environmental safety of food, prevent food waste and make our product and service offerings more sustainable overall, as well as to provide efficient solutions to simplify our customers’ business activities. At the same time, we want to minimise our environmental and social footprint by responsibly managing people and resources and creating a positive impact on society overall.
It is our vision to make retail more sustainable along the value chain in our work with small and medium-sized independent suppliers and customers and in contact with consumers. By reconciling our needs and goals with the needs of nature, people and future generations, we can act responsibly, remain successful in the long term and overcome the conventional limits of growth. Through information, inspiration, motivation and support of our employees, customers and partners, this visionary approach has the potential to reach millions of people.
The guiding principles for us are the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). These goals also form the global action framework for our corporate strategy, which is shaped by the principle of sustainability. Inspired by the SDGs, we have refined our sustainability approach. With our areas of responsibility (Empower) People, (Secure) Planet, (Unfold) Prosperity and (Enhance) Partnerships, we support the SDGs, in particular the goals in which we are most directly involved: 2 (Zero Hunger), 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth), 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production), 13 (Climate Action) and 17 (Partnerships for the Goals).
Environmental matters
A responsible consumption of energy and other natural resources is crucial for all of us. The use of resources has a direct effect on our operating costs and may entail undesirable environmental implications, such as the emission of climate-damaging greenhouse gases. Our approach is to reduce the climate-relevant emissions caused by our business operations and our consumption of natural resources.1 We do this by focusing on behavioural change (Energy Awareness Programme) and investment aimed at increasing our energy efficiency (Energy Saving Programme). Wherever possible, we are also converting our cooling systems to natural refrigerants (F-Gas Exit Programmes). This reduces our energy requirements as well as our costs. In financial year 2017/18, among other things, we invested €10 million in METRO Wholesale’s Energy Saving Programme, which saves us approximately €2.8 million in energy costs each year.
1 Due to the company size and alignment (management), the aspect of environmental matters is not significant for the holding company, METRO AG.
Climate protection target status
Greenhouse gas emissions in kg CO2 (CO2 equivalent)
per m2 of selling and delivery space
Further key focal issues in relation to sustainable business operations are the prevention of waste, the reuse of resources and their recovery by means of recycling. The reduction of food waste is an issue of particular importance to the operations of METRO. METRO has therefore committed itself to the Resolution on Food Waste by the Consumer Goods Forum (CGF) and thus to eliminate 50% of wasted food in our own operations by the year 2025 compared to 2016.
Social matters
Supplier development
In order to offer our customers an assortment that meets their requirements, the availability, condition, quality and sustainability of our products play an important role. We have influence on this through direct contact with our suppliers as producers and manufacturers. By training small and medium-sized suppliers on aspects of food safety, hygiene, processing and implementation of fair working conditions, we enable them to meet relevant standards and thus help them merchandise their goods. This increases their revenue and simultaneously secures our product range.2
2 Due to the business alignment, supplier development is not a significant aspect for the holding company METRO AG.
Respect for human rights
Respect for human rights is one of the fundamental values of the METRO group, as formalised in our ‘Policy for Human Rights’. We pledge to respect all human rights, as set out in the United Nations’ Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work of the International Labour Organization (ILO). This obligation applies to our own employees and to our business partners within our value chain.3
3 For the holding company METRO AG, the aspect of human rights in the supply chain is not essential owing to its business alignment but rather only in relation to its own employees.
Global labour and social standards in the supply chain
We aim to contribute to ensuring socially acceptable working conditions within our sourcing channels. Social standards systems enable us to take effective action against any potential violations. We will therefore require our producers to be audited in accordance with the supply chain management standard set out by the Amfori Business Social Compliance Initiative (Amfori BSCI) or an equivalent standard. This applies to all producers in certain high-risk countries (based on the Amfori BSCI rating) that manufacture imported goods for METRO SOURCING. It also applies to the producers of non-food items for our own-brand products and our own import products. All suppliers producing for us4 must prove at least acceptable audit results by 1 January 2019.
4 This includes merchandise producers (non-food own-brand products and own non-food imports) in high-risk countries that carry out the final significant value-creating production step, for example produce the final item of clothing.
In order to not only ensure the social requirements of our suppliers, but also to contribute to improving them and thereby further increasing the proportion of valid audits, METRO SOURCING works with our local producers and supports them through training courses designed to understand and comply with social standards.

95,es-dense,1000,200,all-MiniLM-L6-v2,5,1,ollama3_1,"Who is the main character in Fox's new crime drama, The Following, and what is his background?","Warning: Spoilers ahead.
When Edgar Allen Poe authored The Raven, the idea of his iconic phrase “nevermore” becoming the calling card for a serial killer lead cult probably never crossed his mind. And yet, that is exactly the case in the Friday debut of Fox’s new crime drama, The Following. The pilot episode brimmed with a potent concoction of compelling characters and tension-fueled pursuit. Whodunit is a misnomer in this case, as the writers make no bones about the identity of the criminal mastermind. A more accurate descriptor perhaps be “howdunit,” as characters are introduced, disappeared, and turned rogue without fulfilling explanations. As a pilot, “Pilot” provides a good example of how good acting and better writing can bring new viewers in and, with any luck, make them series faithfuls.
Kevin Bacon leads a cast that, in large part, is wisely unknown. His character is Ryan Hardy, a mostly disgraced FBI agent turned true crime author. In a former life, Hardy single-handedly took down the season’s notorious serial killer, Joe Carroll, but now spends most of his time drinking and scowling. When Carroll escapes from prison, the FBI puts Hardy in the famous shoes of Michael Corleone, thinking he was out and being pulled back in as the one man who knows Carroll above all.
We soon discover that Carroll, played by James Purefoy, is more than your average psychopath. He’s the literary type, a college professor and author with an affinity for Edgar Allen Poe. Before his series forming turn, he was happily married. A flashback sequence shows he and his wife laying in loving embrace as she tells him she’s expecting. Not long after we find out that Carroll, perchance, dove a little too deep in the Poe Pool and latched onto the author’s belief that death is the truest form of beauty, specifically that of young women. Being the creative sensitive type, and following the critical failure of his debut novel, he decides to correct things by turning serial murder into his greatest work of art. These murders, he explains to Hardy, make up his great novel, his completion of Poe’s unfinished work. As a result of these extravagances, he’s also a celebrity with dozens of websites and thousands of followers around the world.
It is beautifully meta, this story within a story, and it’s the kind of crazy that drives you to know more. Like the best serials before it – Lost, for example – enjoying The Following comes with a sense of wanting. A wanting to understand; a wanting to know what comes next; a wanting for everyone to get out safely but at the same time not to get out safely. And episode one delivers on that front. Carroll explains the show itself in his final monologue. Hardy is the hero rising. His loss, his failure is the inciting event. Walking away from “Pilot,” there is a palpable expectancy that we’re about to witness the Carroll’s story. Not Hardy’s, not the victim’s, but the killer’s, and just as he wants us to see it.
A number of other characters take stage in support of Bacon and Purefoy. There’s the hard-nosed cop waiting to be won over. The starstruck newbie itching for his hero’s attention. Then there’s Carroll’s wife, and Hardy’s former and inevitable flame, Claire Matthews. Her son also, the cute and kidnapped Kyle, who seems to be the driving force for the season to come. All of these seem like mainstays for future episodes but they lack depth. They fill their purpose in “Pilot” and I could see them becoming interesting as we discover more of their backstories, but for now they’re mostly cardboard cut-outs of what good writing will allow them to become.
Less memorable are the villian’s henchmen and where the hard questions begin. In Carroll’s employ are the nanny, the gay couple next door, and the wanna-be mass murderer CO. Each of these seem to have long-standing relationships with the main characters, but the viewer is left to wonder how Carroll could have manipulated these people and placed them so perfectly from behind bars. “Pilot” explains it away with Carroll hacking the prison computer system, accessing the internet, and turning his “fans” into a cult. Is it normal for lit professors to also be computer hackers? And, being a mass murderer and all, no one thought to check up on what he was doing on those computers, even if he was thought to be offline?
It stretches believability but the writing is just good enough to give it a pass. This time. Like other great shows, there’s something here that makes you want to believe it’s possible, that maybe some explanation will come along to wipe it all away. Or even that the show gets good enough that we can forgive it in the name of growing pains. Still, let’s hope being a criminal mastermind doesn’t mean Carroll can do and access anything he pleases.
The real triumph of The Following is that it isn’t afraid to let you fall. From the very beginning viewers are introduced to the beautiful and lone survivor, Sarah Fuller. The show dotes on her. She’s in danger, vulnerable and exposed, and it’s easy to care about her. She’s also central enough to the episode’s storyline it lulls you into a sense of security. When the ending comes and you discover her fate, it’s a shock to the system and honestly a little heart breaking. It’s events like this that make Carroll’s words linger in the mind after the show has finished. The writers are openly manipulating you but Purefoy’s performance transcends the character barrier; it’s not the writers doing anything, it’s Carroll. He is the writer. The only one we need to care about, anyway.
Going into The Following, I didn’t know what to expect. Kevin Bacon’s performances have been hit or miss in the past, and, indeed, his work here is occasionally one-note and smacks a bit too much of David Caruso in CSI: Miami. But it fits, just as most other parts fit, and the high notes pull everything else just a little bit higher from the muck. Believability is an issue, no doubt about it, but the writers are skilled and, if this episode is any indication, we’ll likely see some explanations surface in coming episodes. I came in cold to The Following but next Friday I’ll definitely be tuning in to see how things unfold.","['Warning: Spoilers ahead.\nWhen Edgar Allen Poe authored The Raven, the idea of his iconic phrase “nevermore” becoming the calling card for a serial killer lead cult probably never crossed his mind.

Here I attached new set of patches that are rebased to the latest master.
0001-Change-Create-Access-method-to-include-storage-handl:
Add the support of storage method to create as part of create
access method syntax.
0002-Storage-AM-API-hooks-and-related-functions:
The necessary storage AM API hooks that are required
to support pluggable storage API and supporting functions
to frame the storage routine.
0003-Adding-storageam-hanlder-to-relation-structure:
Add the storageAm routine pointer to relation structure
and necessary functions to initialize the storage AM routine
whenever the relation is built.
0004-Adding-tuple-visibility-function-to-storage-AM:
The tuple visibility functions are moved into heap storage AM
and the visibility function in snapshot structure is changed from
function pointer to an enum to indicate what type of snapshot
it is. Based on that enum, the corresponding visibility function
is executed from the relation storage AM routine.
0005-slot-hooks-are-added-to-storage-AM:
The slot specific storage AM routine pointer is added to slot
structure and removed some of the members and created
a new HeapamSlot structure to hold the necessary tuple
information. Currently the slot supports the minimal tuple
also.
Currently this patch may further needs some changes as it
assumes the tuple is in HeapTuple format in some API's.
This slot storage AM routine may be common to all the
pluggable storage modules.
0006-Tuple-Insert-API-is-added-to-Storage-AM:
The write support functionality is added to storage AM.
And also all the storage AM functions are extracted into
another file to make it easier to understand while writing
and changing the code to support new API's.
0007-Scan-functions-are-added-to-storage-AM:
All the scan supported functions are added to storage AM.
And these functions are also extracted into storageam.c file.
Pending comments from Andres:
1. Remove the usage of HeapScanDesc.
2. Remove the usage of scan_getpage, scan_update_snapshot
and scan_rescan_set_params hooks.
3. Many places the relation is not available while creating the slot,
and also slot shouldn't depend on relation, because the slot values
are may be some times from two different storage relations also.
So I modified the slot code to use the same storage mechanism.
4.Tuples functionality moving into a separate folder.
Other pending activities are:
1. Handle Bitmap and sample scans as they dependent on heap format.
2. Add some configuration flags in the storage AM, based on these flags
whether vacuum can run on these relations or not will be decided. This
may be further enhanced to provide the cost parameters also that can be
used for planning.
I attached individual patches in the mail, in case if it increases the mail
size,
or creates problems to some one, i will attach the zip version from next
time
onward.
