0,chroma,1000,200,all-MiniLM-L6-v2,5,1,ollama3_1,What is the Berry Export Summary 2028 and what is its purpose?,"Caption: Tasmanian berry grower Nic Hansen showing Macau chef Antimo Merone around his property as part of export engagement activities.
THE RISE and rise of the Australian strawberry, raspberry and blackberry industries has seen the sectors redouble their international trade focus, with the release of a dedicated export plan to grow their global presence over the next 10 years.
Driven by significant grower input, the Berry Export Summary 2028 maps the sectors’ current position, where they want to be, high-opportunity markets and next steps.
Hort Innovation trade manager Jenny Van de Meeberg said the value and volume of raspberry and blackberry exports rose by 100 per cent between 2016 and 2017. She said the Australian strawberry industry experienced similar success with an almost 30 per cent rise in export volume and a 26 per cent rise in value to $32.6M over the same period.
“Australian berry sectors are in a firm position at the moment,” she said. “Production, adoption of protected substrate cropping, improved genetics and an expanding geographic footprint have all helped put Aussie berries on a positive trajectory.
“We are seeing a real transition point. Broad industry interest and a strong commercial appetite for export market development combined with the potential to capitalise on existing trade agreements and build new trade partnerships has created this perfect environment for growth.”
High-income countries across Europe, North America and Northern Asia have been identified as having a palate for Australian grown berries with more than 4244 tonnes of fresh berries exported in the last financial year alone.
The strategy identified the best short-term prospect markets for the Australian blackberry and raspberry industry as Hong Kong, Singapore, The United Arab Emirates and Canada. The strongest short-term trade options identified for the strawberry sector were Thailand, Malaysia, New Zealand and Macau.
The strategy focuses heavily on growing the existing strawberry export market from 4 per cent to at least 8 per cent of national production by volume, in markets with a capacity and willingness to pay a premium for quality fruit. For raspberries and blackberries, the sectors aim to achieve a 5 per cent boost in exports assessed by volume across identified markets by 2021.
Tasmanian raspberry exporter Nic Hansen said Australia offers some of the sweetest and most attractive berries in the world, and this combined with our stringent food safety standards across all stages of the supply chain puts growers in a solid position.
“We have a great product, we are hungry to expand trade and now with this new plan in place, we have a clear roadmap towards driving growth,” Mr Hansen said.
He said it is exciting to see new export market prospects for raspberries: “The more options we have for export the better. Now we just have to get on with the job of ensuring industry has all the tools it needs, such as supporting data and relationship building opportunities, to thrive in new markets.”
This project was commissioned by Hort Innovation, and developed by market analysts and research consultants Auspex Strategic Advisory and AgInfinity. Hort Innovation will work now with berry sectors to determine levy-funded activities to support trade.

Perspectives
Reach and benefits:
- Self-supply is practised by millions of rural households in Sub-Sahara Africa as well as in Europe, USA and other areas of the world.
- Benefits reported from having access to Self-supply water sources include convenience, less time spent for fetching water and access to more and better quality water. In some areas, Self-supply sources offer important added values such as water for productive use, income generation, family safety and improved food security.
- Sustainability of services from Self-supply is high as there is strong ownership by people investing in own sources.
- As Self-supply sources are shared sources, many people, including poor and vulnerable households, benefit from investments in Self-supply, often at no costs. This means that Self-supply can be effective in reaching the hard-to-reach.
- For millions of people in rural areas of Africa, supported Self-supply will be the most cost effective service delivery model to provide access to safe water. This also includes those parts of the population which actually have poor access as they e.g. cannot afford water from communal supplies.
- However, in areas where external support for Self-supply is lacking, only marginal improvements can usually be achieved, and the quality of services is lower than in areas where a dedicated support effort was made.
Costs and business model for supported Self-supply
- In many rural contexts, supported Self-supply is the most cost effective approach for water service delivery. However, as it is not applicable in all contexts, a blended approach combining communal water supply and supported Self-supply models should be followed.
- Based on a Life Cycle Cost (LCC) analysis of different service delivery approaches, the LCC for communal supplies are about 40 US$/capita served in the study countries, whereas the LCC for supported Self-supply is about 10 U$/capita.
- In sparsely populated areas, communal supplies (e.g. handpumps) are even more costly (up to 100 U$/capita served) as only few people can be served with one additional unit. Serving all rural people with communal supply is therefore not financially viable.
- Considering the applicability of Self-supply technologies, in Zambia and Zimbabwe, the cost saving of following a blended approach using both communal supplies and supported Self-supply is almost 50% of the total LCC for reaching 100% of the population by 2030. These cost savings are equivalent to more than 330 million US$ in Zambia and more than 260 million US$ in Zimbabwe.
Support services needed
- Supported Self-supply is a service delivery model putting support services in place to improve Self-supply, so it is not about a particular technology.
- Supported Self-supply is aligned with the Human Rights to Water and Sanitation, which allows a progressive realisation of the universal access to safe water. However, supported Self-supply is not a way to exempt government from its duties: Government has specific roles to play to ensure that everybody will have access to safe water finally.
- To sustain and to take Self-supply to scale there is need for contextualised support as well as long-term engagement, capacity development at all levels, M&E and technical support, reliable funding and learning and sharing.
- Interministerial cooperation and champions within government agencies are needed to ensure sustainable embedding and for taking Self-supply further, particularly in remote rural areas.
- There is no-one-size-fits-all solution for supported Self-supply – for each programme, it needs a contextualized design and follow-up to achieve desired impact.
- Hygiene promotion, including Household Water Treatment and Safe Storage (HWTS), is highly recommended for any non-piped water supply services, including Self-supply water sources.
- The huge potential for substantially improving the level of water supply for millions of people in rural areas should be accessed through supported Self-supply. Some countries have endorsed supported Self-supply as service delivery model, such as Zimbabwe or Sierra Leone, and in Ethiopia, Self-supply is now being scaled up at national level.

Description
Coolands for Twitter is a revolutionary twitter client. It has many unique features, gives you the best mobile twitter experience you never imagined before.
The first unique feature is Real-Time.
You can’t find any refresh button in this app, because you absolutely don’t need to. Every time you open it, you’ll get the latest tweets and while you’re reading, you’ll get incoming tweets in Real-Time. So if your friend mentioned you, you can reply instantly.
The second unique feature is Avatar Indicator.
Avatar Indicator is small avatars showed on the title bar to indicate that you’ve got new message/tweet/mention. Since it’s real-time, you’ll keep getting incoming tweets while you’re reading your older timeline, Avatar-Indicator will let you know who’s tweet you’ve just got, and decide whether to check it out right away.
The third unique feature is Direct Link
I think it is obviously the most intuitive and convenient way to open a link. When you want to open a link, just click it in the time line . You can also click a username to open a profile window, click a hash tag to open a search result window. Different kind of links displayed in different colors, you can change it to whatever color you like.
The fourth unique feature is Smart Bookmark
Have you ever experienced this scenario? When you are reading your home timeline, the app notified you that you’ve got some new tweets, you click “go-to-top” button to read the newest tweets, and then you want to get back to the previous position to continue your reading. How can you do this? In other twitter clients you have to scroll down all the way to find where you were, a lot of time wasted. But in this app, “go-to-top” button will appear when you scrolling up, click it, you can got to top, read the newest tweets. After that when you scrolling down, Smart Bookmark button will appear at the corner. Click it, you can get back to exactly where you were.
The fifth unique feature is User Level Notification
Notification for all your new tweets is meaningless, if you following more than a few users, you’ll get new tweets all the time. What if you only want to be notified when someone you most care about posted a new tweet? In this app, it’s easy. You can change your friend’s notification setting directly in his/her profile screen. You can also set different notification ringtone for your friends respectively. So when you heard a notification ringtone, you’ll know who he/she is without the need to open your phone. And you can manage all the enabled User-Level-Notification settings in one place.
Also has most of the basic twitter client features, like post/delete tweets, retweet, retweet with comment, reply, quote, send/delete direct message, subscribe/unsubscribe lists, follow/unfollow user, multiple accounts support, append picture with your tweets, mention auto complete, recent search auto complete, conversation view.
Please give me feedbacks if you have tried it, and I PROMISE to reply all your emails.
1.30-1.36 update:
*Ad-Free.
*3 times faster when launching and loading older tweets.
*Support unlimited accounts rather than 3 accounts.
*Support notifications for all accounts rather than only for the current account.
*Improved mention suggestion feature.

3,chroma,1000,200,all-MiniLM-L6-v2,5,4,ollama3_1,What is the main difference between the National Sample Survey (NSS) and the India Human Development Survey (IHDS) in terms of measuring India's inequality?,"How unequal is India? The question is simple, the answer is not.
For some 60 years, the only reliable information about India’s inequality was coming from the annual National Sample Survey conducted from 1951. NSS is one of the most venerable surveys in the world of poverty and income distribution statistics. India started fielding it soon after its independence: the survey was supposed to track how the new government fought poverty, to provide information on caste differences, rural-urban gap, caloric intake, especially of the poor and many other statistics. Since its main concern was with poverty, the decision was made to survey consumption, that is, how much people actually consume (do they have sufficient number of calories) rather than income (how many rupees they earn).
For all these decades since 1951 NSS was the key instrument that allowed researchers from India and the rest of the world as well as Indian policymakers to know what is happening with India’s population. India could thus boast to have had a longer series of annual surveys than most rich countries (that often launched their similar surveys in the 1960s). But in addition the survey also benefited from some reflected glory which had to do with the ideals and hopes raised by the Independence and thus it had a bit of this Third World-Bandoeng Summit-Mahalanobis glow always attached to it.
But the problems started in the 1990s when the survey numbers began to diverge more and more from National Accounts statistics: NSS was showing consistently lower rates of growth, and higher poverty than many people thought it should be given India’s fast growth. This led to the famous Great India Poverty debate in which participated Angus Deaton, Amartya Sen, Jean Drèze, T.N. Srinivasan, S. Subramanian, Martin Ravallion and many others. Several representative articles are given here and here and here.
The gap between the slow moving survey mean and much faster changes in per capita GDP was also explained by the failure of NSS to capture top incomes. The top incomes may have been pulling up the mean (presumably reflected in GDP per capita) and if surveys continued, partly by design and partly by the reluctance of the rich to participate, to be focused on the bottom of the income distribution, that could explain the rising gap between NSS and national accounts.
And if indeed that was the reason, or one of the reasons, then another unpleasant conclusion imposed itself: inequality in India may be (far) higher than implied by NSS data.
And indeed, as the graph below shows, NSS kept on producing a fairly stable consumption Gini (calculated here on household per capita basis) over several decades, with only a small increase in inequality after India’s sharp turn toward capitalism in the early 1990s. That Gini, ranging between mid- and higher-30s, made India inequality look about the same as in developed countries.
/>
But until recently we had no other reliable and nationally-representative survey to confront NSS with. Now, thanks to the joint work by University of Maryland and National Council of Applied Research in New Delhi, we have (harmonized by LIS), the first income based surveys of Indian population for 2004 and, just released by LIS, another same survey for 2011.
And the results are very different from NSS’s. First, Indian Gini is remarkably consistent in both 2004 and 2011 and is (on per capita basis) 51 Gini points. This is at the level of Latin American countries and is some 15 points (or almost 40% ) higher than the Gini’s calculated from NSS. Thus a key question is immediately asked: is India’s inequality more like Latin American? NSS was saying for years that it is not; the India Human Development Survey (IHDS) argues it is.
For 2011, I have both micro data from NSS and micro data from IHDS and when I compare income/consumption by each percentile (note that these are entirely different people though), the results do make sense. For the lowest percentiles, consumption is about twice income, and everybody up to the 33rd percentile consumes more than their income (which you would expect in a poor environment). After that point, consumption consistently and monotonically falls short of income (that is, there is saving), so much that among the top 5%, income is twice as high as consumption (saving rate is 50%). Overall, the mean per capita income from IHDS is 47 percent higher than the mean per capita consumption from NSS, and as we have said, Gini is some 15 points higher.
This “reasonableness” of the data, and the absence of discontinuities when comparing income and consumption leads one to believe that it is possible that both NSS and IHDS provide accurate information (with likely underestimation of top-end consumption and income), but that income distribution in India is much more unequally distributed than consumption.
So if we compare India with other countries that use income surveys, this is how it looks (see the figure below). India seems slightly more unequal than Brazil, and more egalitarian than only South Africa.
There are many other issues that are worth exploring here, in particular if we want to look more carefully at the consistency between the two surveys, but I would like to end by considering the role of the new income survey for India from an unusual angle.
As mentioned before, since NSS was the only game in town, all our global poverty and inequality statistics were done using NSS. Now, if we replace NSS with the new income survey as I have done for the global inequality calculation for the year 2011 (unpublished), you may expect that the greater inequality revealed by IHDS would push global inequality up, especially since India is such a populous country. Right?
Wrong.
What happens is that global inequality goes down by approximately 1 Gini point since the higher income levels implied by IHDS push Indians toward the middle of the global income distribution and more than offset the contribution to higher global inequality that comes from the stretched-out Indian distribution. Thus, somewhat paradoxically, a global implication of a new, and I think more reasonable, approach of viewing India as a country with Latin American levels of income inequality is that global inequality, as calculated so far, might have been overestimated.
In conclusion, more unequal but richer India, makes the world more equal.

Round One:
Nelson in his usual Karate style stance keeps out of range of Cummings early strikes. Then he presses into the clinch, but Cummings matches him and they jockey for position. As they break apart Nelson lands a good knee.
Nelson lands a right hook. he misses with an overhand. Nelson very relaxed, but he’s very alert and continually makes Cumming miss by backing up just enough. A right hand counter lands for Nelson, but then Cummings moves to his back and clinches up. Nelson turns though and then breaks away from the clinch.
A head kick is blocked by Cummings. Pace slowed a little now in the final 90 seconds. Cummings leaps in and nelson counters with a punch to the body. More missed shots from Cummings and then he moves into the clinch. Nothing doing and they back up. However, Cummings then comes back in and does finally land a few nice punches while Nelson has his back against the cage. Not for long though as Nelson circles out and that’s the final action of the round.
Round Two:
Nelson biding his time in the opening minute of the second as Cummings continually tries to land strikes, but generally comes up short. however, Cummings does back him up against the cage and unleash a flurry that foces Nelson to clinch.
They stay in the clinch for a while trying to gain an advantage, but it’s stalemate and they disengage. Not much volume in Nelson’s striking so far this round, but he does land a speedy right hand that clearly hits the mark. Certainly better accuracy from him, but a little more offense wouldn’t go astray.
Again he finds a home for a clinical right hand. He starts to close the distance more now, but remains patient and just snaps off another quick right.
Into clinch range and Nelson reaches for a guillotine choke and goes to the mat with it. He fluidly switches on to Cummings back. He lands a few punches and then swiftly locks in a rear-naked choke.
Impressive stuff from Nelson in the way he was able to transition so slickly to his dangerous ground game and he forces Cummings to tap with only twelve seconds of the second round remaining.","['They stay in the clinch for a while trying to gain an advantage, but it’s stalemate and they disengage.

6,chroma,1000,200,all-MiniLM-L6-v2,5,1,ollama3_1,How did Dan Foley feel about his portrayal on the Survivor TV show?,"Dan Foley: My Survivor Portrayal Was Unfair
The latest castoff expresses his frustration about how he was portrayed on TV
Over a period of three days, multiple cameras film between 300-500 hours of footage. Then, a team of editors boil all that footage down to one 44-minute episode.
Dan Foley, the latest contestant voted off the island, says he watched the first two episodes and realized that he was going to get a villain’s edit. But even he seems surprised at how negatively he was portrayed – and how vitriolic the viewer response has been.
So what did we miss? Foley, a 47-year-old postal worker from Maine, was happy to tell us.
Okay, there are going to be some tough questions today, but let’s start with an easy one: what could you have done differently to keep from going home?
You know, it’s easy to be an armchair quarterback. If I had only known that Carolyn had the immunity idol, I would have voted out Sierra.
You used your extra vote during the tribal council. Do you think that made you a target?
I said it before: superfans can’t do basic math. It made no sense for me to play that vote when there was an odd number of people left. I wanted to play it when there was an even number. And what you didn’t see was that Sierra came to me and said that Will was ready to get rid of me. And then during Tribal Council, Will said, “If Dan has the advantage, he should use it.” It was the right time to play it.
Fair enough. So what was your reaction when you were voted out? Were you angry at Carolyn?
Look, anyone who walks out of the game with a smile on their face didn’t play the game. I left that game with a fever of expletives. They didn’t show it, but I was swearing and spitting and seething after my torch was snuffed. I was absolutely furious, calling Mike every name in the book. But I don’t wish anyone ill will.
Okay, I need to call you out on your statement that flippers never win.
They don’t.
They do.
No they don’t. Tony Vlachos was a backstabber, not a flipper.
Okay, but Vecepia Towery won season 4 and she flipped twice. She flipped to vote out Boston Rob at Final 10. Then, at Final 9, she flipped back and took out the Rotu alliance.
But did she win?
Yes. She won the million. She beat Neleh Dennis.
Huh. Okay.
And Sandra Diaz Twine flipped multiple times to win.
Well, Sandra is a different case altogether. But Cochran flipped, and did that work for him?
No. No one says that all flippers don’t win. But flippers can and do win. Also, there was Danni Boatwright in Guatemala…
(Laughs) Yes, she played a good game. But I still believe that flippers don’t win. I really do.
Okay, let’s move on to the ugliness of the season. Your character was very difficult to root for.
I talked to Jeff Probst the other day and I ripped him a new one. I said, “You did me wrong. You did me dirty. You screwed me on my edit. You made me look like a piece of s—.” And Jeff said, “How do you figure?” And I said, “You cherry-picked things to show, sometimes out of context.”
Get a Tour of Jeff Probst’s ‘Spectacular’ Pad
I don’t know you. I only know the edited version of you. Are you saying that it was incorrect?When I am pushed, I push back. And I was pushed a lot. They didn’t show that. Lindsey, Sierra … they said things to me and pushed back. Look, I was always the fat guy. I learned how to stand up for myself. But you didn’t see what other people were saying or doing.
You took a lot of heat for your comments to Shirin.
Look, there’s not a single person on this season who didn’t say derogatory things about Shirin. Even Mike called her a man-hater. I made an unfortunate comment about slapping her. I had no idea about her past. None. Zero. I would never have made that comment. I apologize for saying it.
But at the same time, my comment was not meant literally. I meant it figuratively. How many times do you hear people say, “I could kill him.” Are they really plotting to kill someone? Of course not.
So where do things stand with Shirin now?
The truth of the matter is that we don’t get along. I don’t wish her ill or badly, and I hope nothing but the best for her. I hope that if she wants to go back on Survivor again, she gets that shot. There are things in her past that continue to haunt her to this day, and I hope that she gets the help that she clearly needs.
You were a big Survivor fan. Now that your reputation has taken a hit, are you still a fan of the show?
My reputation has not been harmed. The people who know me know that my edit was not who I really am. I don’t have a problem telling the truth. There are people who love me, and people who hate me. There is no real middle ground. the people who hate me can’t handle the truth.
But do you still love the show, or has your view been tainted?
How can you not have a tainted vision when you pull back the curtain and see that Oz is pulling on the levers? I’m a little disappointed, but I still love the show. Would I play it again? (Long Pause) Yeah. In a second.","['Dan Foley: My Survivor Portrayal Was Unfair\nThe latest castoff expresses his frustration about how he was portrayed on TV\nOver a period of three days, multiple cameras film between 300-500 hours of footage.

We have a quiet week as far as making dinner because we have lots of fun social plans, so we’re going to post a few lunch recipes too, just to keep things interesting.
We went to the Yankee game Sunday afternoon with our friends Jeff and Marie. As per usual, we ate our share of fun ballpark food, so we’ll have a little snack at most for dinner.
While Kim has a meeting at the New York Junior League on Monday, Tony will be out for dinner with his buddies, so Kim will be on her own once she gets home. While our dinner plans are different, we’ll probably have the same thing for lunch: The New York Times’ Green Garlic Tabbouleh. Kim made tabbouleh a few weeks go, but this recipes gives things a fun twist by using spring garlic, which is in season right now, but not for much longer.
Kim is going to a lecture Tuesday night and Tony will probably end up working late, so we’ll either meet up somewhere for dinner or just meet at home and order in. On Wednesday, Tony will be having dinner at a work event, so Kim will be on her own. Again, different dinners, same lunch, in this case The Minimalist Baker’s 30-Minute Portobello Mushroom Stir Fry. We’ve found that despite Lent being long over, we’re still skewing pretty vegetarian/pescatarian, and this dish fits the bill, though Tony may add a little chicken to it to mix things up.
Kim will be back at the New York Junior League on Thursday, so Tony will be on his own for dinner. On Friday, we’re going to an event organized by Tony’s university alumni organization: an exhibit of the works of Robert Ryman to be held at the Dia:Chelsea on West 22nd Street. We’ve had a lot of fun at previous alumni events, so we’re looking forward to this one. We’ll probably grab dinner somewhere near the gallery.
We have tickets to the ballet on Saturday, but will probably have dinner at home in the form of Food 52’s Cilantro Lime Salmon Cakes with Chipotle Mayo. If you’ve been following our blog for the past few weeks, you might notice that this is the third time we’ve had the recipe on our weekly menu.

I kind of felt this coming, so I'm not very surprised at all. Been hooked on this site since 2006/2007 but have kind of felt the general enthusiasm in your writing drop in the last half of this year. Really glad though that you let the year run to an end before putting the site to sleep. No need to drag it any longer if it's more of a chore than a joy.
Can't thank you enough for keeping this site running with new entries every friday. You know how to keep your readers and listen to them. ;) Musically, it has been an eye-opener into so much exciting stuff. Personally, it's been a very healthy road to follow and a sanctuary in the Internet chaos.
Looking forward to some action on the new site!
Cheers!

As a memorial, I'd love to see a list of the Top-however-many albums since starting the site -- 1996-2008 yes?
Sure, if we see ratings as immutable we could more or less do this ourselves, but I'm interested in how things have changed; would OKC and Agaetis Byrjun still top the list? What have you discovered long after its time?
This site has been a regular visit of mine since ... 2003 maybe? and it's been delightful to see how hard you work to promote bands that might not otherwise get noticed by anyone. At the same time, I absolutely see how the numerical rating bell curve can grow exhausting -- music writing was made to instill pleasure, to be a sprawling manifesto, to be something you want to do. I find if I can write at length about anything, I inevitably end up liking even the things that I might have reservations about. I really look forward to seeing where you go from here. Best!

As much as you’d like to think that you can handle your love and relationship problems on your own like a champ, it never hurts to get advice (or even an entirely different perspective) from people who have already been there, done that, and set up an appropriately themed podcast to talk about it.
But with the sheer number of love and relationship podcasts out there, you just can’t help but wonder: Which ones among them should you be listening to?
And frankly, does it even matter?
Seriously, how many different ways can people actually talk about such a universal and all-encompassing emotion as love?
As it turns out, quite a lot — and these five love and relationship podcasts are among the best and most unique ones out there.
Love Is Like A Plant with Sarah May Bates and Ellen Huerta
What do you get when you combine two experts on love and heartbreak in one podcast? An informative and in-depth conversation about planting the seeds of love in your life and making it last, no matter what kinds of challenges come your way.
Ellen Huerta, the creator of break-up support app Mend, teams up with Sarah May Bates, the self-improvement and emotional coping guru, on Love is Like a Plant. This one-of-a-kind podcast revolves around a single question: “If love is like a plant, how does one keep it alive?”
From defining a relationship to dealing with how to end it, Ellen and Sarah take listeners through a wide spectrum of love, sex, dating, and break-up advice, offering helpful advice and witty commentary along the way.
Relationships! Let’s Talk About It with Pripo Teplitsky
Relationships aren’t just about love or sex. From the way we talk to our siblings to how we cope with a dear friend who’s moving away, interpersonal relationships are rife with so many little issues and particulars that we sometimes get lost in the shuffle and forget the things that really matter.
Those small yet significant things are what psychotherapist and professional marriage and couples counselor Pripo Teplitsky tackles in each episode of Relationships! Let’s Talk About It. Pripo often has guests on his show with very interesting stories to tell.
Whether it’s a problem with your best buddy, your parents, your neighbor, or even your roommate, Pripo’s more than happy to talk about it—and even talk you through it.
Unqualified with Anna Faris
Some would look at a celebrity and wonder what a person who probably has everything she wants could ever offer in terms of relationship advice. After all, life’s generally a smooth cruise for these superstar types, right?
Actress, model, and author Anna Faris smashes that stereotype and serves up some delightful nuggets of wisdom in the amusingly titled podcast, Unqualified.
Anna features celebrity guests on her show, and asks about their personal lives in a way that’s both thorough and respectful. She’s also refreshingly open and honest, and is quite adept at keeping the mood fun without losing the emotions behind each story shared on the podcast.
Confessions of a Terrible Husband with Nick Pavlidis
The image of a husband in the proverbial doghouse, forced to spend the night lying on the living room sofa instead of beside his wife, is often played for laughs in pop culture. Author and motivational coach Nick Pavlidis, however, uses that mental image to deliver wise, honest, and hilariously self-deprecating stories revolving around the point when he realized that he was far from the ideal husband he’d thought himself to be.
Nick tackles an assortment of marital problems with the ease and expertise of a man who has spent one too many nights on a lumpy couch (and isn’t ashamed to admit it). On Confessions of a Terrible Husband: Lessons Learned from a Lumpy Couch, he shares his stumbles and challenges as a husband (which he jestingly calls “moron purgatory”), infused with advice from qualified relationship experts.
And yes, he will gladly help you pronounce his last name properly.
Savage Lovecast with Dan Savage
The name of this podcast works on so many levels. Not only does author and public speaker Dan Savage host the Savage Lovecast, but the subjects it deals with are also… savage, for lack of a better word.
Since 2006, Dan has been dishing out real talk on dating, sex, and love (even way before #realtalk or podcasts were a thing).
Whether it’s standard relationship stuff or more taboo topics that would make your parents and grandparents blush, Dan’s definitely got something substantial to say, delivered in an unapologetic and entertaining manner.

10,chroma,1000,200,all-MiniLM-L6-v2,5,1,ollama3_1,Which two teams dropped out of the Primal Quest Utah race and what were their reasons for doing so?,"Primal Quest Utah has now entered its third day. Over the race's first two days, the 365 athletes from 20 nations have competed in temperatures reaching 104 degrees, riding horses, mountain bikes, and riverboards in the Green River, trekking across the desert, and hiking through Utah's notorious slot canyons. The lead teams have covered roughly 200 miles; the teams at the back of the field are more than 75 miles behind. Gordon Wright sends us this from the race course.
This year's Primal Quest is so hot, so hard, and so long that race organizers have been largely concerned with what could go wrong. While heat stroke, dehydration and horseback riding injuries are relatively rare in most adventure races, they are real concerns in this one, as well as the more common issues such as injuries, exhaustion and logistical challenges.
This anxiety has been largely mitigated by the fitness of the competitors and the planning of the race staff. Astonishingly, only two teams have dropped out: Team Utah and Team xxTreme US. Both drop-outs bring surprises: Team Utah would seem to have a home-town advantage, but quit due to blisters and exhaustion. Team xxTreme US is largely comprised of Navy SEALs — notably hard men who were undone by injury.
""I don't think you could reasonably take 400 people off the streets — or even out of a gym — stick them in the desert for two days and expect them to survive,"" said Primal Quest Course Director Don Mann. ""But these athletes are so fit they're not only surviving but making good progress.""
Amid all the concern over the extraordinary heat and the capriciousness of the horses, a race broke out. Four teams ran and paddled neck and neck all throughout Day Two, never getting separated by more than twelve minutes. Among the leaders is Team Nike/Powerblast, the odds-on favorite led by defending champions Mike Kloser and Ian Adamson. Two teams led by women are also among the leaders: Team Merrill/Wigwam, captained by Robyn Benincasa and Team Spyder, captained by Danelle Ballangee.
What makes that top grouping interesting isn't just that they're led by women, but that Benincasa and Ballangee are former teammates of Kloser and Adamson. The reasons for Ballangee and Benincasa leaving their male teammates and starting their own teams are many, and while the racers proffer respect, hard feelings remain.
There is still more than 200 miles of racing to go - and the lead teams have logged only four to six hours sleep in more than three days. But what is clear is that the ghosts of teammates past are dogging Team Nike, and it doesn't look like they're going away any time soon.
Farther back in the pack, the pace was more stately, and the camaraderie much more present. Team Pedro's Boulders was preparing to launch its kayaks into the Green River for 35-mile paddling leg when field correspondent Bob Heady caught up to them.
Iona MacKenzie was stuffing her backpack into her kayak's hatch and painfully recalling Sunday's horseback section. Her horse stepped on her foot and broke a toe; she didn't realize the seriousness of the injury until the beginning of the eight-mile riverboarding segment. She was 108 miles into the race, and she couldn't pull her swim fin on.
MacKenzie's teammate Charlie Kharsa gave her one of his fins, which was a couple of sizes bigger, and that ""solved"" MacKenzie's problem.
Kharsa now had one fin that was two sizes smaller than his foot, but if anyone in the race could shrug it off, it's Kharsa, who several years ago completed a riverboard voyage down the length of the Grand Canyon on the Colorado River.
Team Semper Fi was also transitioning from riverboard to kayak. A group of U.S. Marine officers, the team has already made a large impression on the race. Blowing away stereotypes, the Marines are far from taciturn and decidedly not buttoned-up. In fact, they seem to be having a blast amid all the misery. One of the team members entered the riverboarding segment by tossing his board into the Green, sprinting down the beach, and hopping onto it for an impressive display of skim-boarding.
Brian Chontosh, who was awarded the Navy Cross for valor in Iraq in 2003, is reveling in a challenge that doesn't involve being shot at. Chontosh and teammate Kevin Saunders are both captains, and therefore lower-ranked than married team members Majors Sarah Fullwood and James Fullwood. When asked whether or not he and Saunders were getting along with their superiors, Chontosh joked, ""We don't want to be anywhere near them — Kevin and I paddle together and plot against them.""
This joking, fun-loving attitude has become a trademark for a group of competitors who, despite the gravity of their occupation, do not take themselves seriously. Chontosh also asked Heady to send a message to front-running Team Nike/Powerblast, ""We've been taking it easy for a couple of days — and we're about to put the hammer down.""
The merry Marines paddled away, 62 miles behind Nike, but with tremendous spirit.
Semper Fi.

Instead of crafting a quick story for a Wednesday’s Word post, I searched for a quote that might give color to the word. I found one that indirectly speaks to my desire to write and the courage it takes to keep me writing, even when the inspiration flickers out.
Today’s word:
quantum. noun.
1. A quantity or amount.
2. A portion.
3. A large amount.
4. The smallest amount of something that can exist independently.
, American business owner, career counselor, author.
A new year approaches. And,2010 calls for fresh goals but demands repeat determination.
Don’t just imagine, Someday I’d like to be a writer.
Write.
Because “anything worth doing is worth doing…” now.
Interesting that you consider it courageous to keep writing even when you’re not inspired. I’ve never thought of writing as courageous … well, not fiction writing. I want to know more of your viewpoint.
I read that quote and immediately thought about the risk in writing.
For years I wanted to call myself a writer; I wanted to take the plunge. But I never ventured outside of my journal or a few personal letters that recounted a silly experience.
Starting a blog was taking a risk. Submitting my first piece (in it’s own infancy) was taking a risk.
It would be easy to imagine the smile on my face when that first novel is finished and published, instead of actually rewriting that novel to submittable quality. And, then sending it out into the query world.
And, I thought of your recent post (), and how even when I feel uninspired or unrecognized (with just one more rejection email to archive), I still write.
I’m in a weird mood, I guess, or maybe I’m completely missing your point, but I’m not being flippant.
Is what you feel you’re risking only the rejection of your work? I know it’s hard not to feel like a conjoined twin with your writing, but I’ve finally accepted that agents and editors are just businessmen and my work is only a product to them.
I realize, of course, for a writer who has to make a living from her writing, selling the product is extremely important. I don’t have to sell my work, so I’ve come to the point where I view the act of writing, the creation of story, as the valuable part … not the selling. So, in that sense, writing is not a risk to me.
I would like to share it, and so I will try to sell it, but if I never succeed, it does not diminish the accomplishment of writing a novel (or story), nor does that make me enjoy my work less.
I don’t think you’re being flippant. Maybe I’m not expressing myself well.
For me, the risk in writing comes in the act itself: to write is to make myself vulnerable, whether I write memoir or fiction, since each story I write reveals a small part of myself or my psyche.
The risk also comes in sharing that story (and that small piece of myself) with others, whether they pay to read it or not.
I hope that reads more clear than my first comment.
Ha ha, you were clear. I was trying to let you know I didn’t want you to think I was being flippant in the comment I was about to make.
I guess a year ago I felt like you. I’ve had enough experience in critique groups now that I don’t think of it as a risk to share my work. But I think I feel more separated from my work than you do.
Christi, I also feel the act of writing takes courage. For me, writing (including fiction writing) is often a painful, fearful experience. What I fear isn’t so much that others will reject me but that I will reject the parts of myself exposed in the writing process.
To be honest, I never thought, Someday I’d like to be a writer. Instead, I thought, Someday I’d like to stop lying to myself. A tiny part of my psyche decided years ago that I’m writer, so now I try to earn the right to say so aloud.
“2010 calls for fresh goals but demands repeat determination.” Yes, and I like the clarity in this statement.
Ann, I love this: A tiny part of my psyche decided years ago that I’m writer, so now I try to earn the right to say so aloud.
Earning the right to say so aloud hits home with me.

In yet another curtsy to the politically correct orthodoxy, President Barack Obama’s.
And the purge of training material regarding Islamic terrorism from law enforcement training is only the beginning. Attorney General Eric Holder told Congress that anti-Muslim instructional materials hurt the country’s fight against terrorist groups like al-Qaeda. As a result of this mentality, the Joint Chiefs of Staff were asked to collect counterterrorism training materials at all military academies and academic centers such as the National Defense Intelligence College and the U.S. Army Combined Arms Center.
“The goal, evidently, is to banish any material that could be viewed as offensive to Muslims,” said the JW blog.
To fulfill this politically-correct mission, the FBI enlisted the Army Combating Terrorism Center at West Point to purge material that conflates terrorism with mainstream Islam, according to inside information cited in the Judicial Watch — arguably one of the most sympathetic lawmakers to Islamic causes — the event came in “response to the spike in anti-Muslim bigotry” and marked the first ever congressional hearing on Muslim civil rights.
It was Durbin who on the floor of the Senate in 2004 called U.S. soldiers Nazis, and detention centers such as Guantanamo Bay “gulags.” He later apologized, but his constituents were happy to hear him denigrating U.S. troops since his district has a very large Muslim population, according to news reports.
According to the Examiner, other Muslim outreach efforts under Obama included; Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano meeting to discuss national security matters with a group of extremist Muslim organizations including members of the Muslim Brotherhood, the nation’s space agency (NASA) being ordered to focus on Muslim diplomacy, and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton signing a special order to allow the reentry of two radical Islamic academics whose terrorist ties long banned them from the U.S.","['By Jim Kouri\nIn yet another curtsy to the politically correct orthodoxy, President Barack Obama’s.\nAnd the purge of training material regarding Islamic terrorism from law enforcement training is only the beginning.

Which aside from being Great Looking, is also seriously Great. It’s the kind of can’t put it down even though the bath water’s turning cold and your skin’s going all crinkly kind of Great.

Morganite is a pastel-coloured crystal, found in subtle shades of pink, lilac pink and salmon pink. It is usual for these gems to be light in colour, even though some are known to exhibit rich tones. It is a variety of the mineral beryl that also includes emerald and aquamarine.
Morganite was discovered in the early 1900’s in California and thereafter in Madagascar. Known initially as pink beryl, the crystal was renamed morganite in recognition of the financier and gem collector J.P. Morgan. The gem is also known as ‘pink emerald’ and ‘rose beryl’.
These stones are comparatively free of inclusions. The availability of huge Morganite rough allows for the possibility of large faceted crystals. The Brazilian stones can weigh more than ten kilograms.
Metaphysical Meaning
Morganite crystals have been linked to the heart
As a result of its subtle tone of pink, morganite crystals have been linked to the heart. For this reason, morganite rings serve excellently as engagement rings. It has been referred to as the Crystal of Eternal Love.
The vibrationsof morganite subtly heals the heart and opens it to unconditional love, repressed feelings and emotional needs that have not been fulfilled.
Morganite’s energy is also linked to the love of the Heavenly, teaching us that we are all linked to a Universal Heart and form part of a broader design.
Morganite is a symbol of beauty
Morganite crystals are great symbols of beauty. They help one to see the beautiful things in life, the energies of which one could absorb into oneself. The love energy of morganite is said to make its wearer more beautiful both mentally and physically.
The gem with exceptional powers
Gemstones of the beryl group have exceptional powers, which means that the properties of Morganite are superior. These crystals are known to aid further in other aspects of spiritual advancement.
Allow the Crystal of Eternal Love to work its magic for you
The vibration of love provoked by Morganite is extremely powerful. As long as the crystal is within your aura, it has an opportunity to work its magic.
So, treat yourself from the remarkable collection of morganite designs from Eldorado Diamonds. Designs that have been specifically selected to deliver to its wearer strong heart-centred energy.

The School of Journalism sponsors several student organizations, including chapters of national organizations. Our student organizations are quite diverse and give aspiring journalists the opportunity to learn, create and socialize with fellow students who share their interests. They gain knowledge about their future profession through hosting guest speakers, social events and hands-on experience.
The officers of these organizations do all of the footwork for bringing in guest speakers; these events are open to the public and university. The organizations host social events that foster communication with other students who share their specific interests. Meeting times listed below are subject to change. Please check the Web site listed or contact the advisor for any changes in meeting times or information about upcoming events.

ORANGE Magazine
ORANGE, UT's student magazine, gives students a hands-on approach to magazine publication. The staff works on all sides of a magazine from advertising to editorial, production to writing, and finances to public relations. After working on ORANGE, the staff leaves with a strong portfolio and enough experience to tackle any one of New York's leading titles.
The Magazine Club (MAG)
The MAG Club in the School of Journalism is designed for those interested in a career in magazines. The club is a great place to begin, a low-pressure way to get your feet wet --- much more social than work!
Scheduled meetings are held each semester, usually once every three weeks with local professionals to discuss their experience in the field, bring in local magazine editors, often our own graduates to discuss magazine careers, and keep a running list of the latest internships and possible jobs.
MAG is one of the few UT Sponsored Organizations on campus, so it is much more than just a ""club."" We also have a working relationship with ED on Campus, the national college magazine club, founded by NYC magazine editors. We will show you how to tie into their national job bank and intern listings.
MAG can also help you, at an early stage here, gain valuable hands-on experience with ORANGE, the campus magazine produced by School of Journalism students. But most importantly, we are just a group of people all working together to achieve success in the magazine industry!
MAG also looks great on the resume. Check the display box for MAG (and ORANGE) on the 6th floor of the College of Communication Building) for more details.

20,chroma,1000,200,all-MiniLM-L6-v2,5,0,ollama3_1,What are some of the guidelines for disciplining a teenager?,"In the light of all the discussion about disciplining your child that the NFL has created, I think this is a good time to talk about how to discipline teenagers, since it is very different from how you would discipline a young child.
When disciplining a teenager you need to remember that the actions that you take when your child breaks the rules are actions that will hopefully help your child learn. Parents question how much “rope” to give a child, worrying that there might be too much, and the child will “hang himself.” Other parent’s worry that being too strict will result in their teen rebelling, losing respect, and not loving them. Others consider rebellion and defiance to be “normal” in teenagers and thus may rarely take a teen’s misbehavior seriously. While to some degree rebellion and defiance are natural, it has been found that excessive rebellion and excessive defiance are usually indicators of an oppositional defiant behavior disorder and are not necessarily associated with health.
The problem is that most parents only have the model of discipline that was meted out to them as children and teens. For many, identification with the normal rebellious and defiant aspects of the teenage years has never been normalized by mature growth; thus they either subtly (or not so subtly) stimulate “bad behavior,” only to follow it, in their own anxiety and confusion, by administering punishment to the adolescent. Not surprisingly, this causes the teen perplexity, anxiety, and confusion.
On the other hand, constructive discipline tends to result in the development of a mature young adult by the end of the adolescent passage. It helps a teenager control his impulses, cooperate with other people, and be patient. The aim of discipline should not be to develop a homogenized and completely socialized teenager; parents should always stress the uniqueness of their teenage sons and daughters. Rather, discipline should result in a teen taking a wholehearted and responsible approach to life. Disciplining a teenager is different from disciplining a younger child since the teenager is more mature, more reflective, and more able to enter into discussions and negotiations. This means that discipline can and should always be enlightening to teenagers, never a means of deriding, shaming, or making them feel as if they are “bad.”
What to Do
- Don’t be a cruel parent. Don’t humiliate, criticize destructively, physically attack, or try to cripple your teenagers will just in order to make him conform to certain rules.
- Make expectations and rules clear to your child.
- Don’t be scared to set limits.
- Do not make rules arbitrarily, even if you feel strong about them; they should involve some give and take.
- Understand that whatever teaching and disciplining you do, most teenagers will mature through trial and error.
- Reward constructive behavior rather than criticize bad behavior.
- Be a role model for your teenager.
- Be compassionate and patient when it comes to discussion of family rules and responsibilities.
- When punishing your teenager it is best to withdraw privileges. However, make sure to not over-punish because you are angry.
- Never use physical or mental torture.
- Don’t give in to tantrums or loud and intimidating behavior, and don’t allow guilt to cloud your judgment.
- Remember, teenagers test the limits. You will be tested!
In the end, be compassionate and empathetic and remember what it was like to be a teenager. Your greatest influence on your child doesn’t come through your punishment but through your being a good role model and your ability to understand the situation and act appropriately..",['No relevant contexts.'],"Some guidelines for disciplining a teenager include making expectations and rules clear, setting limits, not making rules arbitrarily, understanding that teenagers will mature through trial and error, rewarding constructive behavior, being a role model, being compassionate and patient during discussions, withdrawing privileges as a form of punishment without over-punishing, never using physical or mental torture, not giving in to tantrums or loud behavior, and not allowing guilt to cloud judgment.

Designed with both formal and nonformal educators in mind, the Virginia Environmental Education Certification program sets a statewide standard for exemplary environmental education practice, encourages exploration of environmental education resources, and promotes professional growth. This certification program is relevant for anyone who educates about an aspect of the environment, would like to strengthen their environmental or pedagogical expertise, and is passionate about professionalism in environmental education.
It has been developed with the North American Association for Environmental Education (NAAEE) accreditation program in mind. That means you can trust in the quality of materials and the learning process of the program, and once accredited, your certification will be transferable to any state with an NAAEE accredited program.
_____________________________________________________
From NAAEE: ""Professional certification ensures that individuals are fully prepared for work within a specific field of expertise. Certified environmental educators meet stringent requirements for proficiency in both the interdisciplinary content and pedagogy necessary to develop and deliver high quality, effective EE programs.
While it is not necessary to attain certification in order to be employed as an environmental educator, certification readily distinguishes highly qualified professionals and enhances the resumes of those who have attained it. Having a community of certified professionals also elevates respect for the profession.""

Certification program development was begun by the Virginia Office of Environmental Education, but when it was closed in 2016, the VAEE chose to continue this work.

These sites continue to be meaningful to Native peoples and are considered sacred to those whose tribes were forced from Ohio long ago. These monumental works of archaeoastronomy and landscape architecture bear remarkable testimony to the multifaceted genius of aboriginal North Americans in the Ohio Valley and to an artistic and cultural flowering that had significant impacts all across the continent between 900 and 2,600 years ago. Inscription on the World Heritage List would underscore the cultural significance of these sites and call international attention to these treasures long known to Ohioans.
The Nomination Process
The U.S. Department of the Interior and the National Park Service control and guide the process that culminates in a nomination of these sites to UNESCO – the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization – which administers the World Heritage List.
Currently the – Fort Ancient in Warren County, the Newark Earthworks in Licking County, and the earthworks included in the Hopewell Culture National Historical Park in Ross County.
The Need for Support
A working group of archaeologists, anthropologists, architects, cultural landscape historians, museum and park administrators, and Native Americans are collaborating to complete a draft of this document for review by the National Park Service before a final submission can be made to UNESCO. Funding is needed to continue the progress toward the completion of the draft nomination: consulting with other World Heritage sites and nominee organizations and other experts; performing additional research; compiling all required data; formulating required management plans; developing economic impact studies, and designing the draft document. The experience of other successful U.S. and international applicants for inscription indicates that preparation of the nomination requires at least one full time staff person and – in addition to the contributions of the working group - the services of various consultants, researchers, photographers, graphic designers, and editors. Therefore, we estimate that an investment of between $800,000 and $1,200,000 may be necessary to document the significance of our sites and how they will be managed, in a comprehensive and appropriate manner designed to elicit favorable consideration by UNESCO.

to raise £40,000 in 40 days, our fabulous new village
hall was opened. Find out more about this remarkable journey
to keep the 100-year-old building at the heart of our community,
and ready for another century of work.
While it may have been a big achievement from the outset,
it was one which received overwhelming and essential
support from a number of trust funds, including the Big Lottery
in Scotland.
It's a remarkable achievement after 15 years of work for
a group of dedicated volunteers who have remained committed
to dragging the historic building and community amenity firmly
into the 21st century. In the words of the committee, a 'new
and exciting facility' has been created to replace the 'much-loved
but decrepit building' that has in the past excluded a proportion
of the community due to its lack of modern-day amenities.
The transformation of the hall into a vibrant, multi-activity
centre for the whole community is now no longer a pipedream.
The entire project didn't come cheap, however. But thanks
to an extensive round of fundraising initiatives, such as
music nights and raffles and donations from a number of local
and national funds, and drawing on the infallible enthusiasm
and commitment for the regeneration project to succeed, work
started on site in the summer of 2007. This was in no small way
due to the amazing, worldwide response to an 11th hour appeal
to raise a spectacular £40,000
in 40 Days by the deadline of 30th June.
To all those who donated to the £40,000 in 40 Days Appeal - thank you! We couldn't have done it without you.

Hello everyone,
I have a question about CAN interface PXI-8512. I have two chassis with PXIe 8880 controllers and with PXI-8512 interface modules.
I need to exchange data between those two PXI 8880 controllers and the question is if I can use PXI-8512 modules to send and receive data with CAN protocol? The data is from third part custom device (vehicle simulator). If it is not possible, how can I exchange data between two controllers?
Thank you for answer.
05-10-2017 05:34 AM
Hello krzesniak1,
the direct answer to your question is yes, you can use CAN to share data between your controllers.
In my opinion it is not the best way though. If the controllers are networked, you can use shared variables (network-published) as explained in this white paper:
THis will give you a smoother programming experience and more flexibility than CAN. Obviously, it may be better to use CAN if you want this data to be a part of a bigger system that uses this communication protocol.
As an unrelated tip, it is best to think of PXI controllers as computers, so you can use any way of communication you would normally use between two computers (TCP, ftp, UDP etc.)
Best Regards,
Nick

Thank you for your advice. However I also use VeriStand to deploy a project and I am not sure how to use a shared variables with VeriStand. I also tried with udp communication, however I did not succeed.
Do you know may be an example where communication between two PXIs is well explained?

Roberto Alagna – My Life Is An Opera (2014)

Recorded: AIR Studios (Londres) du 1er au 6 septembre 2014 et à Abbey Road Studios (Londres) le 8 Septembre 2014
Roberto Alagna is THE most well-known French tenor worldwide, with 30 years of career on stage, and 60 opera roles in his repertoire. For this all-new album, he sings selections both familiar and less well-known as well as duets with soprano Aleksandra Kurzak. Highlghts include selections from I Pagliacci, Manon Lescaut, Madama Butterfly, Roberto Devereux and many more.
A cynic might look at Roberto Alagna’s new disc, ‘My Life is an Opera’, and think, ‘At least he admits it’. From his stormy La Scala stage departure to his relationship with Angela Gheorghiu, Alagna’s personal life is…well, operatic. Somewhat embarrassingly, the disc’s booklet has each of the arias listed (out of order from their disc sequencing) to illustrate some signpost in his life, though instead of dealing with the aforementioned incidents in this loose autobiography, the text speaks of the ‘meteoric’ rise of this ‘golden-voiced handsome young genius’. (Oh dear.)
But anyone who thought the medium-weight Alagna voice was on the way out with his Radamès and Otello might be dumbfounded at his excellent state of vocal health on the disc, and the sure dramatic instincts behind it. Most of the repertoire seems new to Alagna’s discography, though there are very few signs of having just learnt arias from Gluck’s Orfeo, The Queen of Sheba (both the Gounod and Goldmark versions) and Reyer’s Sigurd.
Aside from forays into Puccini’s Manon Lescaut and Leoncavallo’s Pagliacci, the programme seems to signify a re-commitment to his fundamentally mid-weight lyric vocal personality, not playing safe in the way he builds phrases and longer-term musical climaxes but rarely pushing his limits (the closest he comes is in an excerpt from his brother David Alagna’s opera Le dernier jour d’un condamné ). Lensky’s aria from Eugene Onegin is in French translation, not Russian. Bel canto choices such as the dramatically charged duet from Roberto Devereux (with Aleksandra Kurzak) don’t require serious coloratura.
The biggest vocal surprise is ‘Magische Töne’ from the Goldmark Sheba, in which Alagna goes into the falsetto stratosphere with a musico-dramatic effect that stands well alongside performances by the great tenors of the past, including Nicolai Gedda and Leo Slezak. Alagna doesn’t have a particularly strong-minded collaborator in the London Orchestra (an ensemble I’ve never heard of) and its Director Yvan Cassar. But recorded sound is first-class. –David Patrick Stearns, Gramophone

With the start of a new school year coming up, teachers are tasked with creating a meaningful learning experience for their deaf and hard of hearing students for the upcoming year. Doing this while navigating Coronavirus is especially challenging. Many have been asked to plan for a semester that accommodates hybrid learning or the flexibility of transitioning from in-person to digital learning at a moment’s notice.
This coming Fall, a teacher’s responsibilities will extend far beyond restructuring their curricula. We know that teachers have an important impact on a child’s mental/physical health, social well being, and more. With everything that our students have been dealing with since March, this impact is more important than ever. Balancing all of these responsibilities, with new school guidelines, in addition to protecting their own health is a lot for one person to handle.
We at CSD Learns want to ease that burden.
CSD Learns STEM Toolkits Are the Adaptable Resources You Need
We have worked with subject matter experts to create a series of STEM Teacher’s Toolkits to use in elementary, middle, and high school. These toolkits are easy to implement online, in-person – or both simultaneously.
Featuring deaf and hard of hearing role models, each toolkit provides educators with several weeks’ worth of lessons (in ASL) that students will love. Each free toolkit has videos, interactive activities, quizzes and more. Keep reading to find the perfect toolkit for your classroom.
Teach Your Middle Schoolers to Stay Safe Online
With our students spending so much time online –even more now with virtual learning – it’s important they know how to stay safe.
Our Developing Your Cybersense Toolkits, created in partnership with RIT/NTID, provide you with four weeks of lessons on cybersecurity. Your students will learn about topics like information security, digital footprints, social media use, and fake news from four deaf and hard of hearing role models.
Inspire your High Schoolers to Pursue a Career in STEM
Did you know that deaf and hard of hearing workers who pursue STEM careers earn up to 30% more than deaf workers in non-STEM careers? In addition to that, STEM careers are projected to grow by nearly 9% over the next eight years. It’s the perfect time to be encouraging students to pursue and education in STEM.
Our “Immersion in STEM” series highlights careers in four different areas of STEM; immunology, nanoengineering, programming, and statistics. Your high schoolers will learn about what it takes to have a successful career in STEM from four pros who’ve been there before!

this is so so so so so lovely
GOSH this is incredibly gorgeous, I’ve always loved the palace as a local but this shoot is drool worthy! Would have loved if they featured the grounds a bit more. Stunning
FABULOUSLY DONE, the cakes r the best of all 4 me followed by the decorations n settings. Overall, its really beautiful.
Very nice and clear picture …… Thumbs up to Mr Alakija again
The only down side, the wedding gowns are so outdated and not trendy ……. Hardly any of the wedding dresses made me say “awwwwwww”
The wedding gowns are in the 90 s so i am a bit confused as this is 2013 …. Those gowns are at best HIDEOUS and take away from the wonderful skills of the photographer. As in seriously who will wear those gowns now for their wedding . The styles are very outdated
Thot I was the only one not seeing “the light”
My sista May God bless you!!!!
The dresses are sooooooo… ugly it is unbelievable. The deco is great, but that’s because it’s in hand and the venue is beautiful.
The cakes are just okay, the gold trimmings on the cake are not smooth, could be better. A little OTT for me.
omg, thought it was just me. worst dresses ever!
This will make you wanna spend money.Classy, Royal, Splendid.
Always fabulous work when it comes to these guys, they are masters of their craft. Inspiration mode activates. Those table layouts are just mwah!
Please apart from the wedding cakes, the dessert table which were certainly impeccably done, the rest of it was blah to me. The tablecloths looked rumpled and frumpy; the wedding dresses not so fabulous, I was actually disappointed.
Please who wears braids on their wedding day??? Let alone very old braids?
There is no inspiration here, nothing I can take away from the photos and nothing that will make me want to contact any of the vendor.
I know plenty people who have worn braids on their wedding day my cousins included. That most Nigerian brides don’t doesn’t mean that the rest of Africa and black female population does not. Not old ones like these I am talking about three day old beautifully styled braids, And aren’t sisters who where locs also braided in a sense and they wear their hair like that for their weddings.
thank God ur name is naija talk. let the oga at the top catch you making such statements. everything about it is lovely.

Diseased Body in Wuthering Heights
In Wuthering Heights by Emily Bronte it can be viewed that there is “more suffering caused by a diseased mind than by a diseased body.” The idea of a “diseased mind” is a mental illness or madness and the “diseased body” is a physical illness or injury, both of which are displayed by many characters in Wuthering Heights.
Heathcliff is a prime example of a character with a “diseased mind” that causes him suffering. He spends the majority of his life contemplating and acting out revenge towards Hindley and the Lintons because he believes it was their fault Catherine thought it would “degrade” her to marry Heathcliff, even though she loved him; this is one example of his unstable mind set. In chapter 9 Nelly foreshadows the suffering of Heathcliff by saying “if you [Catherine] are his choice, he’ll be the most unfortunate creature,” this is because Nelly understands that society wouldn’t accept the pair to marry, therefore Heathcliff will be unfortunately heartbroken. Heathcliff believes that Catherine is a part of him: “I cannot live without my soul,” he says which highlights that he is suffering without her. It is from this heartbreak and suffering that his “diseased mind” commenced. Heathcliff’s “diseased mind” heightens when he asks for Catherine to “haunt” him when she is dead; haunting is an element of the Gothic genre but the madness of Heathcliff is enhanced when he requests that Catherine drives him “mad.”
The word “mad” is ambiguous in this quotation because it could be viewed that Heathcliff wants to be haunted until he is angry with Catherine so he can destroy his love for her. An alternative view is that Heathcliff wants to be haunted until he is insane and suffering since he is desperate to see Catherine, this becomes true because after Catherine’s death Heathcliff’s mind is haunted by his love for her. Jerold E. Hogle explains this is accurate because characters in Gothic novels are “haunted psychologically” and this is accurately shown through the character of Heathcliff. His mind is “diseased” by his separation from Catherine due to her choice of partner and her death, which causes him and everyone in the novel immense suffering because of his vengeance.
Heathcliff’s unconditional love causes Catherine’s “melancholy” “mental state” because it is overwhelming and she is in love with him but a Victorian society wouldn’t accept their relationship because of the Heathcliff’s very low class, which would result in them being “beggars.” Catherine has “a peculiar expression arising from her mind set” before she tells Heathcliff “you have killed me,” this highlights her “diseased mind” and the suffering it is causing her because she hasn’t died yet but it could be interpreted that she feels as though she has which emphasises her suffering, but also her madness. The “peculiar expression” that Catherine is described to have could be because she was “thinking… of Wuthering Heights.”
The “expression” could be interpreted as a smile, which would be “peculiar” to Nelly because she has been depressed living with Edgar, therefore a smile would be unusual; David Punter explains “Gothic reminds us we are driven by our passions” and Catherine’s passion is Heathcliff, which would explain her “expression” when thinking about Wuthering Heights. This idea of Catherine’s thought process in her “diseased mind” emphasises her pain and suffering because she cannot be without Heathcliff, her “soul,” yet she is continuously thinking about him, this is essentially what drives her insane.
Catherine’s mental suffering is closely linked with her physical suffering which is an example that represents the “diseased body” in Wuthering Heights. Another character with a “diseased body” in Wuthering Heights is Isabella, whose “bruised” body is a valid example of suffering. Heathcliff’s “diseased mind” causes him to abuse Isabella which leads to her suffering and her injured body

Don't stress about what you need to buy for your mother's special occasion; for most Mum's the best present is your presence.
Yes it's that simple, just spend time with her, no store bought card, bunch of flowers or chocolates will warm her heart as much as any small efforts to show her how much she is appreciated.
To help here are 5 ideas to choose from which are sure to make your Mum feel special and happy.
1. As I mentioned presence is key, Mum was born before the information age, she misses the simplicity of these times. Go old school, put your phone away and have a good old chat with your Mum. Share something significant that's going on in your life and then ask her what it was like for her at your age. Her memories of this time are really vivid and you are likely to have some similar experiences to draw upon.
2. Go on a road trip together. Listen to music, chat and explore somewhere neither of you have been before.
3. Your Mum is going to love and cherish any home made gifts. She will spill over with joy knowing that you took some time to think about her.
- Make a card, or art piece, write a poem or a story.
- Make her a movie or a photo collage.
- Make a playlist of all the songs she loves.
4. Do something you love with your Mum. Dance, yoga, art, cycling.... if you are passionate about it, then your Mum will love this glimpse into your world.
Last but not least...
5. The thing that will totally make your Mums day is to tell her you love her, let her know you appreciate all she has done for you and that you value her little pearls of wisdom.","[""5 Ways To Totally Make Your Mums Day\nDon't stress about what you need to buy for your mother's special occasion; for most Mum's the best present is your presence.\nYes it's that simple, just spend time with her, no store bought card, bunch of flowers or chocolates will warm her heart as much as any small efforts to show her how much she is appreciated.\nTo help here are 5 ideas to choose from which are sure to make your Mum feel special and happy.\n1.

Describe the management process within the contexts of what managers do, resources they manage, and levels at which managers perform their roles. Integrate modern views of management with the management process. Apply the management process to all personal and professional activities. ++ SCENARIO ++ Krista Connelly is a second-year pharmacy student. Like most second-year students, she describes her life as “incredibly stressed out.” A typical day consists of getting up at 6 am, getting dressed and running out the door by 7 am, and driving to school to get to her first class by 8 am (making sure to avoid the accident on the expressway that she heard about on her way out the door). While at school, she finds time to squeeze in cups of coffee and snack bars between the lectures, labs, and workshops that usually last until at least 4 pm. She also makes a point to go to the library to prepare upcoming assignments, as well as to meet with her professors to review how she did on her examinations. ++ After class today, Krista has an Academy of Students of Pharmacy (ASP) meeting. Krista is the president of her chapter and works with committee chairs to accomplish the goals of the organization. In the past few weeks, she has helped the new professional service chairperson develop a diabetes screening program, talked her fundraising chairperson out of quitting, and wrote a report on each committee’s activities for the chapter website. While Krista enjoys her leadership role in ASP, she finds some of the people she works with to be frustrating and wonders how she can motivate them to do a better job. ++ After her meeting, Krista drives to a fast-food restaurant to grab a quick dinner on her way to her part-time pharmacy intern job. If she is not working, she will head to a friend’s house to study for an upcoming examination. She usually gets back to her apartment by 10 pm and mentally prepares for what she needs to",['No relevant contexts.'],"Dr. Zgarrick's research interests are in pharmacist workforce issues, professional service development, and the use of evidence-based medicine by pharmacists.","Dr. Zgarrick's research interests include exploring the impact of technology on human behavior and communication, particularly in the areas of social media, online communities, and digital culture.",1.0,0.0,0.4963794292945573,0.9102031872904658,0.785517717178229
36,chroma,1000,200,all-MiniLM-L6-v2,5,0,ollama3_1,What did Barbara Coombs Lee suggest to help more people die in peace?,".
Compassion & Choices President Barbara Coombs Lee made a comment during an end-of-life (EOL) panel discussion that resonated fully: to help more people die in peace we need to “redefine the standard of care at end of life.”
Think about this. Redefine the standard of care at end of life.
This compact statement is everything required to support us all in achieving the peaceful demise virtually all of us say we want, yet barely an inverse number achieve. It’s so simple, and so profound.
Barbara’s phrase takes the act of redefining language—my launching point when conceiving and discussing how to advocate when hospitalized, and how to achieve a peaceful demise—to a fully dimensional place. Because language, no matter it’s power, is less dimensional than action. Language, as powerful as it is in framing our expectations and thoughts, merely informs action. Action in medicine equals treatment. Treatment is fully dimensional. We act on language; we experience treatment. We die, and survivors live, with the results of treatment choices we make, or fail to make.
The advent of life support technologies in the 1960s and development of a home for them (the intensive care unit, or ICU) has its clinically logical extension in the chronic ICU facility, with floors of beds for dozens or hundreds of comatose bodies maintained on life support).
Applying this technology endlessly, some would say mindlessly, at the end of life has evolved into the standard of care. But by whose definition?
The irony of American culture is that we seem to pay homage to the notion of individuality yet in many matters, especially how we exit this planet, we traipse along like lemmings. Medicine has defined the EOL standard of care. By and large citizens have acquiesced to medicine’s definition, even with survivors from family after family recoiling from their experiences.
My mantra bears repeating: we actually have to do something in order to increase the likelihood of dying in peace. I begin to articulate what it is we must do here and here.
Part of my language assessment is that our experience of treatment does not feel like or equate to care. Yet providers believe that the treatment they offer equals care. Now, we’ll never strip the letters ‘care’ from the healthcare conversation, for evident reason. But we can examine and clarify obfuscating language so as not to lose the first week of a terminal (or any) hospitalization to bewilderment over what is not happening and what is happening.
What constitutes the standard of care has been invisible, like the air in a flotation device. The device is nothing without the air, yet we never think or speak in terms of that air, only the floaty. But redefining the standard of care is something we can act on and influence. Because that’s about agreement, and consent or refusal to consent. That’s our personal, social, and legal right. The right to informed consent at end of life is being slowly codified into law. But that’s all about the provider side. What about the citizen side?
THE missing voice from panel after panel about EOL matters is ours: citizens’. By “citizens” I mean informed citizens; patient-family members who’ve been through the forest and have mapped it. Articulate people who’ve transformed from harmed persons into patient advocates or activists. We have insightful comments to add because we have deeply parsed the kinds of experiences you really do not want your patient-family to have.
We’re out here. Some, like me, have been recognized by the Institute of Healthcare Improvement (IHI), a well-respected non-profit responsible for significant advances inpatient safety. Redefining the standard of care requires more than panels of medical and policy experts with no informed citizen representation.
Patient advocates bring a different voice to the conversation. I suspect our voice is regarded as scary by panel hosts (if not many panelists) because it necessarily comes from gut level. This implies real feeling, but does not imply craziness. Ours is the voice of passionate clarification, not the dispassionate voice of the clinic or the legislature.
