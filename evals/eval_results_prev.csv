We meet Frances before she boards the ship when she’s working as a nurse, and the other nurses are standoffish with her. But it seems like this is how Frances likes it. On the ship, where these four women share a cabin, Frances is fine being alone and hiding in the crowd.

 ""It should be noted that there are some features available in the classic clicker systems not available on these. The most noticeable one is that it is not recorded who responded to what. You get the interactive benefits in class, but lose the ability to track how students are doing, as well as using it as a way to record attendance. The other issue is the question of whether every student would have a compatible device, and if that were a basic free cell phone, a text messaging plan that wouldn't cost them extra to use it.\nIt would really be great if someone created an open source solution for this. It seems like it would be within the capabilities of the Plone content management system which we use on our campus, although it would probably require some special scripting or workflows to make it workable. (You know who I'm talking to here).""
 'A more likely scenario which uses devices almost all students have in their possession, is Poll Everywhere. The instructor side is entirely web based, so you can use it on either a Windows or Macintosh. On the response side, you can use any device that can access the web, via a web page or Tweet, and also regular phone text messages, a modality dear to the heart of college students. Between laptops, notebooks, smart phones, iPod Touches, iPads, and regular cell phones, almost every student would likely have some device that could respond. Each individual question is set up as a poll, but you can group polls and move from one to another rather easily. You can choose to view a ""static chart"" that just displays the possible answers and the codes needed for submitting, and when you\'ve received all the responses, switch to a ""live chart"" which displays the results. Polls can be embedded in a Powerpoint slide. The big limitation with Poll Everywhere is that it\'s only free with up to 32'
 ""The system would probably have to be web based. Eliminating text message responses would reduce the universality as with Poll Everywhere, but I think it would still have a lot of application. For example, in our College of Nursing, all students are required to have a smart phone, and in several nursing classes I've been in recently, every student had a laptop open (following the instructors Powerpoint, I might add). I'd be willing to bet it's not unusual to see College of Business classes where everyone had a laptop, netbook, ipad or smart phone, and likely upper division science courses too. And keep in mind, the price of admission here would be as low as a refurbed iPod touch, which college kids could also find lots of other uses for, and who knows how cheap Android devices will get. If the system was free otherwise, and lots of instructors adopted, I'd bet it would encourage students to get some kind of device to make use of it.""]","The platform offers academic writing services to students.

3749,zephyr_1,What services does the platform offer to students?,"Otus, a pre-integrated student performance platform, provides data management, assessment management, classroom and learning management, email/text communication with parents, student portfolio creation, and partnership with Thrively and academic data integration. However, some features of classic clicker systems, such as tracking individual responses and attendance recording, are not available. Poll Everywhere, a web-based polling system, allows responses via web, Tweet, or text message and has a free version for up to 32 polls. Both platforms aim to overcome the lack of interoperability in edtech solutions by providing multiple functionalities in one platform.","['with the packages that they have in hand. It cannot go full force because we need to understand that not all our students can get connected especially that high school also use the internet in the house hold but at least twice a week we’re going to try to come on line and give that first hand support to our students through the Google Classroom platform but then we have also closed in the gap by ensuring that all of our parent are online with us via a Whatsapp or via our La Inmaculada School app. So we have three mediums that we will be reaching out to children.”'
 'HOW TO OVERCOME THE LACK OF INTEROPERABILITY\nHere at Otus, we’re approaching the obstacle of interoperability by building a “pre-integrated” student performance platform. Rather than using 6-8, or sometimes as many as 12, individual edtech solutions, Otus takes the best of each and puts them into a single platform. This is Otus — Data Management, Assessment Management, and Classroom and Learning Management, all together. Moreover, Otus helps teachers email or text parents, create student portfolios, and compile a student profile created through our partnership with Thrively and your district’s academic data.'
 ""It should be noted that there are some features available in the classic clicker systems not available on these. The most noticeable one is that it is not recorded who responded to what. You get the interactive benefits in class, but lose the ability to track how students are doing, as well as using it as a way to record attendance. The other issue is the question of whether every student would have a compatible device, and if that were a basic free cell phone, a text messaging plan that wouldn't cost them extra to use it.\nIt would really be great if someone created an open source solution for this. It seems like it would be within the capabilities of the Plone content management system which we use on our campus, although it would probably require some special scripting or workflows to make it workable. (You know who I'm talking to here).""
 'A more likely scenario which uses devices almost all students have in their possession, is Poll Everywhere. The instructor side is entirely web based, so you can use it on either a Windows or Macintosh. On the response side, you can use any device that can access the web, via a web page or Tweet, and also regular phone text messages, a modality dear to the heart of college students. Between laptops, notebooks, smart phones, iPod Touches, iPads, and regular cell phones, almost every student would likely have some device that could respond. Each individual question is set up as a poll, but you can group polls and move from one to another rather easily. You can choose to view a ""static chart"" that just displays the possible answers and the codes needed for submitting, and when you\'ve received all the responses, switch to a ""live chart"" which displays the results. Polls can be embedded in a Powerpoint slide. The big limitation with Poll Everywhere is that it\'s only free with up to 32'
 ""The system would probably have to be web based. Eliminating text message responses would reduce the universality as with Poll Everywhere, but I think it would still have a lot of application. For example, in our College of Nursing, all students are required to have a smart phone, and in several nursing classes I've been in recently, every student had a laptop open (following the instructors Powerpoint, I might add). I'd be willing to bet it's not unusual to see College of Business classes where everyone had a laptop, netbook, ipad or smart phone, and likely upper division science courses too. And keep in mind, the price of admission here would be as low as a refurbed iPod touch, which college kids could also find lots of other uses for, and who knows how cheap Android devices will get. If the system was free otherwise, and lots of instructors adopted, I'd bet it would encourage students to get some kind of device to make use of it.""]","The platform offers academic writing services to students.
