Jojo Moyes gives us a fictional account of this fascinating story in her wonderful book The Ship of Brides.\nWe are introduced to four women: Jean, a young, naive 15-year-old bride; Avice, a rich, snooty bride; Margaret, a pregnant, farm-girl bride; and Frances, a mysterious, war-nurse bride. But they all have secrets.

 'Margaret is the one that seems like she can get along with everyone, so I would’ve hung out with Margaret, too. She’s calm and understanding, but she can hold her own, which she’s had to do with a house full of men and no mother around.

We meet Frances before she boards the ship when she’s working as a nurse, and the other nurses are standoffish with her. But it seems like this is how Frances likes it. On the ship, where these four women share a cabin, Frances is fine being alone and hiding in the crowd.
