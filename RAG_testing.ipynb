The numbers on the D20 were configured into two sets of 0–9 and 0–9 and it was up to the owner to color in one set of those numbers to differentiate 1–10 from 11–20. Well, we went ahead and took care of that for you by placing a gold dot on one half of the numbers indicating that you should add +10.
