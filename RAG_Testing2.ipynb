The numbers on the D20 were configured into two sets of 0–9 and 0–9 and it was up to the owner to color in one set of those numbers to differentiate 1–10 from 11–20. Well, we went ahead and took care of that for you by placing a gold dot on one half of the numbers indicating that you should add +10. We understand the adrenaline rush of seeing that NAT 20 come up so we went ahead and placed the five pronged symbol of Arkhan’s Dragon Goddess as the high number not only on the 20 side but also on the high numbers on the other four dice as well!\\nEach set includes a black metal coffin (with magnetic lid) for safe transport.\\nOur Chromatic Gemstone_0<<',\n",
