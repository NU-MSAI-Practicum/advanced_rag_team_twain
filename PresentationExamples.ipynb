      "Looking to the future, a resurgence in the popularity of traditional Scottish forenames in recent years is likely to combat Anglicisation, said Hough.\n",
      "“Far more Gaelic and Celtic-derived personal names are being chosen by parents in Scotland, which can be a way of affirming national identity,” she says. “Gaelic-derived forenames that are in the top 100 names in Scotland at the moment include Aiden, Callum and Finlay. Cameron is originally a clan name, and Lewis, Evan and Isla are all place names.”\n",
      "You can view a map of Scotland’s most popular surnames at Tartan Footprint.Tagged\n",
      "My father is a Ross. How can I find out about our ancestors\n",
      "My father is a Simpson from Frazer clan. How can I find out about our ancestors?\n",
      "according to my grand mother some of my ancestors moved from Scotland to Finland in the early-mid 1700 but i do not know much else than that. it would be really helpful if someone could lead me to other sites and such where i can find out more of stuff like this.\n",
      "==================== Context: 4 ====================\n",
      "In the Northern Isles Halcrow, Drever and Flett survive as the third most common surnames, while Shetland still boasts a diverse mix of Spences, Rendalls and Sinclairs. Carole Hough, professor of onomastics – the study of name origins – at Glasgow University, said the surnames of Orkney and Shetland differ from much of mainland Scotland due to naming traditions.\n",
      "“Shetland and Orkney are unique in that they have a much higher proportion of surnames from local place names, which makes them quite distinctive. Place names tend to cluster around their origin, which is surprising given how mobile people are,” she added\n",
      "The English derived surname Smith is the most dominant across the whole of Great Britain with a considerable stronghold in the lowlands and east of Scotland. Modern-day immigration shows in areas such a Glasgow’s Pollokshield’s East, with Ahmed, Ali and Singh popular surnames. Jones, Davies and Williams dominate in Wales.\n",
      "==================== Context: 5 ====================\n",
      "The primary identifier of a family is its “name.” The patronymic of a family is the “name” derived from the father, which generally becomes the surname of any of the family’s children. When a baby girl is “named” after her mother, she has received a metronymic.\n",
      "Now on to two more words that derive from the English root onym meaning “name.” A homonym describes a word whose “name” sounds like another’s but is different in meaning. For instance, the words “dear” as in “precious” and “deer” as in “a four-legged woodland creature with antlers” are homonyms because their “names” sound the same but they have different meanings. An eponym is an imaginary or real person’s “name” put upon a place. An example of an eponym is Europe, whose “name” came from the mythological bull Europa.\n",
      "Now no longer will the root word onym run around anonymously, having no “name,” since at least you will not be fooled!\n",
      "- anonymous: without a ‘name’\n",

      "The second name was applied to the whole family and Tom Bakers wife and children were also Bakers. The family name was handed on, and Tom Baker’s son kept the name Baker, even if he became a Vut olvar or a carpenter.\n",
      "In Ireland and Scotland, the second name was often taken from the father’s first name, O‘Brian means son of Brian and MacDonald means son of Donald. Some families were named for places. The Hills and Wells, the Lakes and Woods originally may have been named for the places where they lived. Some families took their names from inns and taverns. Old inns were often named for animals, famous persons or outstanding objects. The family names Lamb and Lyon, Wolf and Swann, King and Queen may date back to ancestors who named themselves after their favorite inns.\n",

      "The use of the English language by Irish people is an amazing thing! It took me a long time to work out the meanings of some of the phrases and sayings when I first came here in 1994.\n",
      "In the early days, people would greet me by asking “what’s the craic (crack)?” and I would respond by looking at them as if they had two heads. I then wanted to know exactly what this “craic” was, so I asked “what’s the craic?” and people would reply “Jaysus, the craic’s ninety!”\n",
      "But in Dublin, it’s a little different. I had to learn a whole new phrase when I moved from the west…. “What’s the story?” it just means “how’s things?” but from a yogic angle, it means so much more.\n",
      "You see, life is just one long story made up of lots of little stories. And everyday we all have our own little stories going on. It’s all “head stuff”. We constantly get caught up in tangled webs of different fables and tales.\n",

Created by experts from three English Universities, Uncertainty of Identity uses surnames listed on the electoral roll to find the three most popular names in each electoral ward.\n",
      "Mackay and Sutherland are the most popular names in the North Highlands, echoing the ancient territories and stronghold of the clans. Mackenzie, Fraser and Ross are the most popular in the area North of Inverness, while MacLeod and MacDonald dominate the Western Isles – data that directly corresponds with clan territory maps.\n",

By installing on-site solar panels and investing in wind farms, we can reduce our carbon footprint by an estimated 40% within the next five years. A recent study published in *The Journal of Cleaner Production* indicates that companies adopting renewable energy sources have seen a reduction in operational costs due to lower utility bills and governmental incentives for green practices.\n",

The initial investment will be offset within three years through savings on utility costs, with a potential ROI of 18%.\n",
